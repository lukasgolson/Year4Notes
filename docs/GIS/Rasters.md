The Basics

-   An "image" is digital as opposed to a "picture" which you take with
    an analog camera
-   Images are made up of pixels which is short for "Picture Element"
-   Pixels contain values (numbers)
-   The more pixels etc. the larger the image file size.

 

 

Color spaces

-   RGB
-   CMY
-   CMYK
-   HSV
-   Grayscale
-   1-bit

 

Additive vs. subtractive mixing

-   Additive color theory
    -   Acts like light
-   Subtractive color theory
    -   Acts similar to painting

 

RGB (red-green-blue)

-   Composite of 3 layers / channels (red,green,blue)

Resolution

Images have dimensions

-   Horizontal and vertical dimensions

 

Resolution (DPI)

-   DPI = dots per inch
-   The greater the DPI per equivalent areas
-   Average screen resolution is 72 DPI
-   Typical printer resolution is 300 DPI

 

Spatial resolution

-   When an image refers to something in the "real world" we say it has
    spatial resolution
-   This refers to the unit of measure in the "real world" that a pixel
    represents in the image
-   e.g., 30 meter digital elevation models (DEM)

 

Remote Sensing System

What is a remote sensing system

-   Energy source
-   Platform
-   Sensor
-   Data recording / transmission
-   Ground receiving station
-   Data processing
-   Expert interpretation / data users

 

Types of platforms:

-   Airborne (like planes)
-   Satellites
    -   Conducted from the space shuttle or more commonly, from
        satellites
    -   Most are at near polar orbit (200 - 1000 km altitude)
    -   Allows the same spot to be mapped over time

 

 

Active sensor:

-   Beams energy and detects the reflection

 

 

Spatial data resolution problem

-   Trade-off pixel size vs. spatial coverage
-   Quantization and data volume
-   Data merge from different sources
-   Grid dislacement in time
-   Information content of different resolutions
-   Raster-vector conversion

 

Geometric registration

-   Where does an image belong on the globe?
-   Before this step, data is just expensive pictures

 

 

Simple IP techniques

-   These techniques are accomplished by applying mathematical
    algorithms to individual pixel values
-   e.g. Brightness simply adds a constant value to each pixel
-   Convolution filters
    -   A matrix of multipliers applied to each pixel as it is moved
        across the image
    -   They are typically moved from left to right as you would read a
        book

 

Image interpretation

-   Interpretation: data -\> information
-   Visual interpretation: uses visual methods to interpret analog data
    (maps)
-   Digital interpretation: uses computer-based methods to interpret
    digital data

 

Image enhancement

-   Usually done to more effectively display or record the data for
    subsequent visual interpretation
    -   Contrast stretching
    -   Filtering
    -   Edge detection

 

Image transformation

-   Arithmetic operations done to combine and transform the original
    bands into "new" images which better display or highlight certain
    features

 

Image classification

-   To categorize all pixels in an image into land cover classes or
    themes
-   Multi-spectral data are used to perform classification
-   Spectral patterns present within data used as numerical basis for
    categorization

 

Integrating remotely sensed data with GIS

-   What GIS has to offer remote sensing:
    -   Control points
    -   Themes
    -   Training Sites
-   What remote sensing has to offer GIS
    -   Rapid updates
    -   Changes detection
    -   Vegetation indices
-   What the future may hold:
    -   Fully integrated systems
    -   Transparent data integration
