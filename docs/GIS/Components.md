-   People
-   Data
-   Hardware
-   Software
-   Procedures

 

 

Time breakdown of most GIS projects:

-   80% Database development
-   10% Data analysis
-   10% Cartographic production

 

 

Three main components to geographic data:

-   Attributes
-   Geometry
-   Behavior

 

GIS Data is organized in Layers

 

 

 

 

What can a GISS do?

Ways to capture data:

-   Digitize
    -   Heads up
