General

Metadata is information about data.

-   Name
-   Who is
-   Age
-   Etc.

 

Metadata is a critical and integral component of data. It should never
be treated as seperate.

 

Example of metadata:

-   Nutrition facts of food

 

Digital metadata formats:

-   Notes or log files
-   Text files
-   HTML file in outline format
-   Customizable (eXtensible Markup Language - XML)

Metadata helps us understand what the data we're consuming is, about,
describes, etc. It's similar to comments in code. 

-   Helps users understand data
    -   Provides consistent terminology
    -   Determine fitness
-   Enables discovery
    -   Makes data searchable
    -   Provides info to clearinghouses (markets)
    -   Provides flexibility in search
    -   Key in sharing spatial data
    -   Documentation
-   Limits liability
-   Reduces workload, questions about data
-   Cuts costs (enables automation)

 

 

 

Why create metadata?

-   Becoming more common as a requirement
    -   Federal mandate
    -   Community / industry pressure
-   Becoming easier to create
    -   ESRI vendor assistance

Why doesn't everyone create metadata?

-   Complex & time-consuming to make, difficult to read.
-   Becomes easier the more you do it, and takes less time
    -   Users should know how to interpret metadata
    -   Helps us become more familiar with the dataset

 

Key Canadian Standards

-   Federal:
    -   Dublin Core
        -   15 elements (web focus, industry support
    -   FGDC CSDGM (minimal)
        -   Middleweight (\~30-300 elements); production rules
    -   FGDC CSDGM (Biological Data Profile \[NBII\])
        -   Heavyweight (over 400 elements); data focus
-   International
    -   Federal Geographic Data Committee Content Standard for Digital
        Geospatial Metadata (FGDC CSDGM) (old)
    -   Now governed by ISO Technical Committee 211

Generally answers: who, what, where why, when, & how

 

Data Dictionaries

Related to metadata

-   A catalog of all data held in a database, or a listing of items
    giving data names and structures
-   Sometimes referred to as a Data Dictionary/Directory (DD/D)
-   Pulls all of your metadata together for your entire project

Quality Assurance and Control

QA/QC is something that needs to be integrated into all aspects of GIS
database development

-   Ensure that everything is accurate, complete, logically consistent,
    and valid (see slides)
