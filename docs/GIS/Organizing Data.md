Introduction:

-   Real world is messy
-   To get data into a GIS, we need to measure "The real world"
-   Measurement is not perfect
    -   Makes assumptions
    -   Represents a particular view of the world
-   GIS data becomes the medium by which users see the "REAL WORLD"

 

 

Levels of measurement:

-   Categorical
    -   Numbers are used as "names" for mutually exclusive sets of
        objects, events, processes, persons
    -   Different values of the variable do NOT indicate different
        magnitudes of any property
    -   Equality and inequality
    -   no \< or \>, no + or -
-   Ordinal
    -   Values of the variable only indicate the rank of the measured
        objects
    -   Higher values =\> more of the property, but not how much more
    -   = and !=, \< and \>
    -   no + or -
-   Interval
    -   Equal differences in the values of the variable indicate equal
        difference in the property
    -   Ratios of variable values do NOT indicate equal ratios in the
        property
    -   = and !=, \< and \>, + and -
    -   No X or /

 

-   Ratio
    -   Equal intervals in variable values indicate equal intervals in
        the property, AND
    -   Equal ratios in variable values indicate equal ratios in the
        property
    -   = and !=, \< and \>, + and -, X and /

 

Accuracy: correctness of measure: difference between prediced, measured,
or observed value and true value; freedom from error.

 

Precision: Closeness of measurements to each other

 

Reliability: reproducibility of results

 

Validity: Extent to which measurements reflect what we intend them to.
Measurements can be reliable without being valid; but not valid without
being reliable.

 

 

Scale:

1:1 is largest

1:24 is smaller
