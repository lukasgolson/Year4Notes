Two broad model classes in GIS

-   Object Based (vector)
    -   Georeferenced and linked to a coordinate system
    -   Basic Data unit = object and is implicit
    -   Located must be explicitly encoded
-   Field Based (raster)
    -   Grid of rows and columns: tessellated
    -   Basic data unit is spatial
    -   Entity (object) information must be explicitly encoded
