Adaptive Management


## Learning objectives
- list important considerations when designing silvicultural systems
- Describe why it is important to adjust silvicultural systems over time
- Describe factors that influence risk in a silvicultural system
- Recall important elements of silvicultural systems
- Understand how silvicultura systems are classified
- Match silvicultural systems with stand attributes

## Definitions of Silvicultural systems
- Planned program of silvicultral treatments throughout the life of a stand
- Series of treatments that promote an approach to management suited to the ecology
- Plan about what fills the growing space and for how long


## Elements of silvicultural systems
1. Alignnment with the goals and characteristics of land ownership
2. Regeneration
3. Efficient use of growing space and site productivity
4. Control of damaging agents (biotic + abiotic)
5. Protection of soil and water resources
6. Sustainability of yield and services
7. Efficient use of capital
8. Safe and efficient operations
9. Maintenance of plant and animal populations
10. Execution of policies


## COnflicting considerations
Sustainability of yield and services vs. efficient use of capital



High forest = trees grown from seeds / seedlings
Low forest = vegetative regeneration
