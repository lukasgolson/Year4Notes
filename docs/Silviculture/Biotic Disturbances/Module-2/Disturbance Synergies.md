## Wildfires
Getting bigger, lasting longer, longer fire seasons
- more heavily suppressed

Due to fire suppression, they are characterized by infrequent, high severity fires due to increased fuel loading + climate change



## Insects
Bark beetles can account for more area disturbed than fire
- Outbreaks from 1980-2005 affected ~47 million ha
Spruce beetle (*Dendroctonus rufipennis*)
- Warmer summers -> voltinism shift

Mountain Pine Beetle (*Dendroctonus ponderosae*)
- Warmer winters/summers + increased host susceptibility (fire suppression) -> range expansion

Pinyon Ips Beetle (Ips confusus)
Warmer summers -> drought -> increased host susceptibility
