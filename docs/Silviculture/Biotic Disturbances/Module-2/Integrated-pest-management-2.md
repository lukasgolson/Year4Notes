## Biological control
- The control or regulation of pest populations through the manipulation of natural enemies or competitors

Biological control approaches
- Classical: importation and establishment of natural enemies for long-term, large-scale pest population suppression/regulation
- Augmentation: mass rearing and release of large numbers of natural enemies for short-term control of pests in small areas
- Conservation: facilitation/enhancement of existing natural enemies over variable spatial and temporal scales
- Biological insecticides: isolation, culture and dissemination of pest-specific diseases
- Semiochemicals (aggregation/anti-aggregation pheromones)


### Classical
#### examples:
- speculatory successes in agriculture (vedalia beetle vs. cuttony cushion scale on citrus)
- Few successes against forest insects -- due to ecosystem complexity?
- Out of favour due to large failures (e.g. cane toad australia), but reconsidered as a tactic due to frequency of invasive species intros

#### Pros:
- Non chemical
- Usually specific to pest organisms
- Potentially long term

#### Cons:
- Non target effects (rare high risk)
- efficacy lags
- public perception
- Long term modification


### Augmentation
#### Examples:
- trichogramma (egg parasitoid)
- Out of favour in forestry due to effort and expense

#### Pros:
- Non chemical
- Specific to pest organism
- Little or no efficacy lag


#### Cons:
- Short term
- Expensive (rearing adn release)
- Public perception


### Conservation
#### Examples
- Few examples in forestry (but see southern pine beetle)
- Increasing interest


#### Pros:
- non chemical
- Specific to pest organism
- Enhanced biodiversity

#### Cons:
- efficacy lags
- large knowledge gaps


### Biological insecticides
#### Examples:
- BTK

#### Pros:
- Mostly non chemical (chemical carriers)
- Largely species specific
- Little or no efficacy
- Relatively inexpesnive
- Ease of application (like pesticide)

#### Cons:
- Some non-target effects (esp. Btk)
- Public perception


### Semiochemicals
#### Examples:
- Aggregation "baits" for many eruptive bark beetle species
- Verbenone, MCH; anti-aggregants for mountain pine beetle, Douglas-fir beetle
- Manipulate populations to better coincide with management objectives

#### Pros:
- Fast acting
- Specific to target pests

#### Cons:



## Silvicultural control
The control or regulation of pest populations through the manipulation of host tree availability and/or susceptibility

- Control approaches
TODO:



### Planting schedules
Examples:
- Choice of tree species and timing of planting post harvest to reduce regeneration pest impacts
- Warren's root collar weevil, Hylobius warreni -- avoid replanting lodgepole pine seedlings immediately adjacent recently killed mature stands
- Post mountain pine beetle -- don't plant lodgepole pine?


### Pros:
- non chemical
- specific to pest organism
- Long term

### Cons:
- potential site degredation
- Potential regeneration delays
- Knowledge gaps - long-term effects



### Thinning / fertilizing / hygiene
Examples:
- thinning, fertilizing; esp. to manage bark beetles
	- "Thin from below" removes background beetle populations from suppressed trees
	- Increases vigour of remaining trees - increases tree resistance
	- Alters microclimate, reduces beetle attack success
- Hygiene
	- Removal of suppressed, damaged amterial to avoid pest population buildup; e.g. Douglas-fir beetle in downed tgrees and large debris

Pros:
- Non-chemical (although fertilizier)
- Optimize tree growth
- Reduce wildfire risk

Cons:
- reduces biodiversity
- Labour intensive, expensive
- Knowledge gaps - long-term effects



### Harvest scheduling
Examples:
- Shortened rotations to extract trees before susceptible to pests; esp. many bark beetles, defoliators that are pests of mature trees

pros:
- non chemical
- long term


Cons:
- reduces diversity; esp. of old growth specific species
- Knowledge gaps - long-term effects


### harvesting infectewd trees


pros:
- non chemical

cons:
- expensive, labour intensive


## resistance breeding
Approaches:
- natural variation: selective planting of resistant provenances
- Artifical selection: controlled breeding to promote pest resistance
- Genetic modification: transgenics (i.e., engineering of novel genes into plants to express pest resistance)


### Natural variation
Examples: Sita spruce provenance selection against spruce weevil, pissodes strobi


Pros:
- non-chemical

Cons:
- Long-term commitment
- Limited deployment potential
- Selection for pest resistance
- Public perception
- Knowledge gaps - long-term effects



### Artificial selection
Examples: Cottonwood hybrids resistance to various insects and pathogens


Pros:
- non chemical
- optimize tree growth/shorten rotations


Cons:
- long term commitment
- limited deployment potential
- selection for pest resistance
- non target effects


### Genetic modification
Examples
- Expression of foreign insecticidal proteins; Btk toxins in poplars against various defoliators


Pros:
- Non chemical
- Optimize tree growth / shorten rotations


Cons:
- long-term commitment
- Stability of gene expression in long-lived trees
- Limited deployment potential
- Selection for pest resistance
- Non target effects
- Horizontal gene transfer to wild populations
- Public perceptions
- Knowledge gaps - long-term effects



## Exclusion and eradication
Minimization of the probability of introduction and establishment of alien invasive species


Pros:
- proactive

Cons:
- potential "knee-jerk" response*
	- We spend lots of resources that might be better spent elsewhere
	- We can't risk making the mistake
	- Place for lots of science to save money
- non-target effects (during eradication)



*Precautionary principle -- "where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degredation"



## Chemical Control
Approaches:
- Broadcast insecticides
- Systemics ("internal" to trees)


### Broadcast insecticides
Do not use
Pros:
- fast acting
- Inexpensive
- effective

Cons:
- hard to target
- potential for massive damage


### Systemic insecticides

Examples
- Neem (azadirachtin) against bark beetles, defoliators, emerald ash borer; "natural" product, largely experimental but promising
- MSMA (monosodium methane arsenate) against mountain pine beetle


Pros:
- fast acting no lag
- specific to target pests
- Limited amounts of active ingredient required


Cons:
- expensive
- Limited by scale
- public perceptions


## IPM in forestry
- Never a magic bullet -- avoid generalization
- For a given IPM strategy, all tactics should be considered and applied (alone or in combination) as specific situations dictate
- IPM is a comonent of forest management, and must complement FM objectives]
