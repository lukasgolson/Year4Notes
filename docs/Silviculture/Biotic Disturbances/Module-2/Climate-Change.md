## Insects are ectotherms
- All aspects of life histories determined by temperature
- Rapid responses to changing climate
- Evidence to date:
	- Behavioral changes
	- Voltinism shifts
	- Range expansion/contraction


Climate and biotic disturbance: it's complicated


Climate
- Insect/pathogens (direct effect)
	- Survival
	- Reproduction
	- Disoersak
	- Geographic distribution
- Tree physiology/resistance (indirect effects)
- Competitors, natural enemies (indirect effects)



All additionally impacted by anthropogenic impacts (fragmentation, pollution, fire, alien ivnasives, etc.)




## Potential effects of global warming on individual forest insects
Positives | Negatives
-- | --
Reduced winter mortality  | Phenological asynchrony
Increased thermally benign habitat | Reduced thermally benign habitat
Reduced host resistance | Shift / depletion of hosts
Escape from competitors / predators | Competition/predation from invasive species
Increased host range (more host species) | Dispersal costs to new habitats



## Potential effects of global warming on eruptive insect populations
- Altered outbreak frequency/duration
- Modified herbivory/damage rates
- Range expansion/contraction
- Novel host species associations


## Prehistoric responses by forest insects to climate change
- Warming does not equal fitness benefit to all insects; however...
- Significant increase in herbivory during PETM
	- Decline in herbivory with subsequent cooling
- Assumption is that trends will follow suit



## Recent climate trends in western Canada
- Significant warming throughout Western North America to Date
- Considerably more warming predicted in the future
- Growing evidence for increased insect disturbances
