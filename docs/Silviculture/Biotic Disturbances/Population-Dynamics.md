Population dynamics = study of births, deaths, and the movement of organisms


- Critical to:
	- Characterization of populations
	- Prediction (spatial and temporal)
	- Management

Size of a population at any given time is determined by
- Natality (births = B)
- Mortality (Deaths = D)
- Immigration (I)
- Emigration (E)

 $$Population Change = B - D + I - E$$

$$N_{t+1} = N_t + (\Delta N)$$


Rate of change:
Change = rate (deaths per number of individuals, births per female)
growth <u>rate</u> (r) = birth <u>rate</u> (b) - death <u>rate</u> (d) + immigration <u>rate</u> (i) - emmigration <u>rate</u> (e)
$$r = (b-d+i-e)$$

$$\dfrac{dN}{dt} = rN$$


Logistic growth:
Pop'ns cannot grow at an exponential rate indefinitely due to food/space limitations, or the action of natural enemies


$$\dfrac{dN}{dt}=rN \dfrac{K-N}{K}$$


- K is carrying capacity; the threshold at which population growth rate (r) is zero, negative above (i.e., the maximum sustainable population)
- As the number of individuals (N) in the pop'n increases, b, d, i, and e changes due to resource limitation, predation, etc.


## Factors affecting forest insect population size
<u>Mortality factors</u>
- climate and weather
- Food quantity/quality'Host susceptibility, habitat suitability
- Predation, parasitism, disease
- Intraspecific competition
- Interspecific competition
- Genetic defects


Density-independent factors
Definition: the proportionate effect on population processes (b, d, i ,e) is not related to population density.


common density-independent factors:
- Site characteristics
	- Elevation, slope, aspect
- Weather
	- Wind, temperature, precipitation
- Biotic factos
	- Browsing, root trampling/compaction, harvesting, etc.

Because the impact of d-i factors on populations is unrelated to population size, the net effect is often dramatic population fluctuations


Density-independent effects: example 1
- Early frosts in 2002, 2005, and 2007 caused high mortality to a spruce budworm population



## Density-dependent factors
Definition: the proportionate effect on population processes (b,d,i,e) is related to population density

common density-dependent factors:
- Competition
	- Interference vs. exploitation
		- Interference = direct competitive interactions
		- Exploitation = indrect interactions, e.g. preemptive use of a resource
	- Effects sometimes non-lethal (i.e. delayed development, reduced fecundity)
- Predation and parasitism
	- Numerical response
		- Predator/parasite population increases when prey/host abundant


Density-deendent effects: role in pop'n dynamics
- Only poissible through 



## The curse of small populations
Normally birth rate (b) increases as population decreases; in very small populations, however, the birth rate may decline due primarily to difficulties in mate location (or inbreeding): **the Allee effect**
- implications to endangered species, invasives
	- A threshold population density is required for a species to persist


## Population eruptions
eruptive species are characterized by distinct population phases -- endemic (sub outbreak) where negative feedbacks predominate and epidemic (outbreak) where positive feedbacks facilitate rapid population growth/spread until negative feedbacks reassert themselves
- Mountain pine beetle as an example
