Douglas-fir tussock moth (orgyia pseudotsugata)

Biology/ecology
- Univoltine (overwinter as eggs)
- Egg hatch and bud burst synchronized
- Newly emerged larvae disperse aerially ("ballooning" or "silking")
- Larvae develop through 4-6 instars
- Pupation occurs during July in cocoons partly composed of larval hairs*
- Wings emerge in August; females wingless, emit pheromones
- Egg laid in frothy mass mixed with female body hairs on old cocoons



Management of Douglas fir tussock moth impacts:
Direct Control:
- Aerial application of a biological insecticide
	- Nuclear polyhedrosis virus (NPV)
	- Will naturally occur over time

Indirect control:
- Selectively harvesting of stands based on risk rating
	- Susceptible sites
	- Optimal larval development
		- Low elevations
		- East slopes
		- Ridge tops
	- Optimal larval dispersal
		- High tree density
		- Large crowns
		- High % DF, Fir



# Shoot, sucking, and galling insects

## General Introduction
Seldom direct tree mortality (occasional seedlings)
- Growth loss, longer rotation
- Malformation, sawlog degrade
- Impacts greatest on young trees
- Indirect mortality via competition

Injury is often positively related to tree vigour
- Injury increased by fertilization, irrigation
- Injury greater in widely spaced stands


Native species in BC
- Coleoptera
- Lepidoptera
- Diptera

## Impact example
- Loss of merchantable volume, total volume might not be affected




## White Pine Weevil (spruce weevil), Pissodes strobi (Coleoptera: Curculionidae)

Hosts:
- Sitka, white and Engelmann spruce
	- Trees 1.5 - 10m tall preference

Distribution
- Transcontinental

Injury patterns:
- Weevils prefer vigorous, open-growth trees
- **Larvae feed in the phloem tissue of leaders, causing dieback of at least 2-years growth**
- ** CONTINUE SLIDES



Biology/ecology:
- Univoltine
- Adults deposit their eggs in punctures near the tip of the previous years leader
- Resin droplets associated with these wounds
- Larvae feed gregariously *down* the leader in the phloem, girdling the stem
- Mature larvae excavate cavities in the wood and pith and line them with wood chips
- By mid-summer the current years leader will appear wilted


Life cycle:



Management
- Intiate dense plantations (2.5m spacing or less)
- Retain volunteer shade trees
- Mixing spruce with other suitable species is recommended
- Thinning and brush control should be delayed as much as possible (beyond 15 years where the trees are no longer as susceptible)
- When available, resistant trees should be used, **always in mixtures with susceptible stock**
- Pruning of multiple tops to leave only one leader should be conducted when economically feasible


## Sucking/galling insects general introduction
Nature of feeding
- Piercing.sucking mouthparts
- Plant part/tissue specialization
- Often preference for healthy/vigorous hosts

Nature of injury
- Nurient loss
	- Inefficient feeders due to low N of substrate
- Patogen transmission
- Phytotoxins and allergic reactions
- Primarily hemiptera (gallers also = hymenoptera and Diptera)
- Most serious pests are introduced

Hemiptera
- Small
- Polymorphic
	- Associated with different hosts, seasons, densities
- Pronounced sexual dimorphism
- Relatively short generation times
- Many parthogenetic (asexual reproduction)
	- Obligate and facultative
- Viviparous (produce live young) and/or oviparous (lay eggs)
- Passive dispersal
- High reproductive capacity
- Greatly reduced body parts
- Complex life cycles
- Galls -- adaptation to sessile lifestyle


Terminology
- Heteroecious = alternating between hosts
- Monoecious = remains on one host
- Holocyclic = complete life cycle, sexual reproduction
- Anholocyclic = always asexual
- Alate = winged insect
- Apterate = wingless insect


General management considerations
- Easily introduced (hard to detect)
- Outbreaks closely associated with changing host susceptibility
- Pheremones unknown/unavailable
- Natura enemies often introduced
	- Ladybird beetles, lacewings

- Some species protected from predators by ants
	- Some ants farm aphids
- Injury/damage to:
	- Intensive production systems
	- Ornamentals, nurseries, christmas trees
	- Biodiversity (i.e. invasives)


Hosts
- ALl true firs (all ages); abies amabilis and A. grandis attacked most frequently, A. lasiocarpa least tolerant to attack

Distribution
- Introduced from Europe around 1900, expanding range;
- Infestation expected throughout south-western BC; range expansion with CC

Injury patterns
- crowns appear chloratic thin, with stunted terminals and possibly dead tops
- Swellings (gouting) occur around buds and branch nodes


## Balsam woolly adelgid

Biology/ecology
- Multivoltine (2-4 generations / year) parthonogenetic, monoecious, anholocyclic, oviparous
- For 1-2 years, nymphs disperse to new locations by wind, birds and mammals, and by crawling
- After dispersal, nymphs insert tube-like mouthparts into tree and remain sessile produce wooly secretions
