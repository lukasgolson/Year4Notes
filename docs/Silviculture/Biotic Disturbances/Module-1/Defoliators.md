# Defoliators
## General Introduction
- 2nd in economic importance to bark beetles
- Many species of defoliators, few cause damage
- Defolitation is ubiquitous in forests -- always some level of injury
- Regulation of defoliator populations typically by natural enemies, seldom food limited
	- Predators
- Weather is extremely important as sa density-independent source of mortality


## Impacts
- Impacts / injury to individual trees
	- Feeding by larvae affects photosynthetic organs
	- Disruption of
		- Production
		- Transportation
		- Subsequent utilization of photosynthate

Reduced photosynthesis leads to:
1. general weakening
2. Growth loss (reduced ring increment)

General weakning and growth loss leads to:
- Increased susceptibility to secondary insects and/or infection:
	- Douglas-fir: beetle infestation
	- Spruce:
- Need more notes here from slides


Altered cone production:
- Light defoliation = increased cone production
	- Stress response
- Heavy defoliation = decreased cone production
	- Depleted reserves used for refoliation

Tree mortality:
- Death of parts of a tree
	- Preferential feeding on new foliage
		- Top kill
		- E.g. western spruce budworm
- Death of entire tree
	- Feeding on all foliage age classes
		- Douglas-fir tussock moth
		- Western hemlock tupper

## Tree Response
- Trees adapted to some level of defoliation (tolerance)
	- Excess foliage (more than required for optimal growth)
	- Energy reserves (stored photosynthate)
- Defence mechanisms to defoliation
	- Leaf toughness
	- Chemicals (constitutive and induced)
	- Hairs, thorns, etc. (trichomes)


Angiosperms are fairly tolerant
- photosynthate reserves
- Refoliation immediatelyh following defoliation
- Multiple years defoliation may deplete reserves
- Species differences
	- Aspen (tolerant) vs. maples (less tolerant)

Gymnosperms intolerant
- Large species differences
	- Photosynthate reserves:
		- Pines less than spruces
- Larch relatively tolerant



Defoliation impacts vary by timing and host tree species
- Early season worse than late; ew foliage worse than old (conifers)
- - Late season = shoot/leaf growth completed; photosynthate reserves established
- Old foliage = less efficient photosynthesis
	- Type of defoliation varies by insects: e.g. budworms (new foliage) vs sawflies (old foliage)

Impacts vary by host tree species


Old versus new foliage
- Old foliage at end of season or older cohorts (low importance to tree)
- New foliage, early season (highest importance to tree)
	- Significant loss of capacity for current & future photosynthate production/storage
		- E.g., spruce budworms -- early season defoliator, preference for new shoots
	- Relatively more new foliage in upper crown of conifers
		- Feeding concentrated in the upper crown; topkill
	- Conditions in upper crown promote injury
		- Sun leaves more nutritious than shade leaves
		- More heat accumulation in upper crown
- Insect preference a guide for impact


Suppressed trees on poor sites
- more likely to suffer
- Crown closure and stand structure affect tolerance
	- Open grown white pine
		  75-100% defoliation = death
	- Shaded white pine
		- 25-50% defoliation = death
	- Poor crown on understory trees
		- Relatively less foliage
			- Fewer insects = growth loss/mortality


## Environmental influences
- Synchronization (i.e. phenology) critical to many defoliators
	- Egg hatch/emergence synchronized to bud burst
		- Determined by "degree-day" accumulation (temperature)
			- Threshold temperature above which development begins
	- Spruce bud moth
		- White spruce buds suitable for colonization less than 1 week
	- Douglas-fir tussock moth
		- Hatch only following 77-97% bud burst


New foliage, why the preference?
- Not as tough
- More nutritious
- But, very ephemeral (available for only a very limited time)

Phenological constraints: Early season defoliator adaptations to access new foliage
- Synchronize feeding stages with bud burst
	- Egg hatch
		- Douglas fir tussock moth
	- Larval emergences
		- Spruce budworms
	- Or utilize older foliage
		- Conifer sawflies
	- Poor synchrony = larval starvation
	- Phenological adaptations by trees to avoid defoliation
		- E.g., black spruce
			- Late bud break
			- 10-14 days later than white spruce and balsam
			- "Immune" to spruce budworm



## Defoliation Impacts
## Sampling and management
Detection and sampling
- reconnaissance flights
- Satellite images

Aerial sketch mapping
- GPS

Ground sampling
- Egg sampling
	- Late summer/early fall
	- Nt+1 population prediction
- Larval sampling
	- Spring/early summer
	- Parasitism
	- Disease
	- Developmental rates

### Management
#### Direct Control
- Biological insecticides
	- BTK
		- *Bacillus thuringiensis* var. *kurstaki*
	- Must be ingested
	- Soil bacterium (natural)
		- Bacteria produce toxin
	- Specific to Lepidoptera
		- Budworms and gypsy moth
		- Timing is critical:
			- Application late enough to ensure sufficient ingestion, but not too late to prevent significant defoliation
- Viruses (biological insecticides continued)
	- NPV (nuclear polyhedrosis virus)
		- Highly specific
		- Douglas-fir tussock moth, sawflies
	- Spray decision
		- NPV is highly effective







## Budworm complex

The phenological window: ephemeral resources


The budworms
Genus *Choristoneura*
- complex of species
- Diverse hosts
	- Most north american conifers
- FINISH NOTES FOR THIS LIST


Budworms vs bud burst: importance of phenological synchrony
- Larval development longer than food availability
- Larval development = 6 instars
- Duration of development longer than shoot elongation
- Resource requirements for large larvae greater than small larvae
- Adaptation = abandon feeding as L1, mine buds/old needles as L2, synchronize L3 to L6 with newly flushed foliage.


Life cycle (C fumiferana, C Orae, C Freemani)
1. Eggs lay: August
2. L1's spin hibernacula: August
3. L2 Feeding: May
4. L2 - L6 Feeding: May - July
5. Pupation: July - August (Holometabolist)


Life Cycle (C biennis) Semivoltine
1. Egg lay: August
2. Egg Hatch/L1s spin hibernaculae: August
3. L2-L4 Feeding May-July
4. L4's spin hibernaculae (overwinter): July
5. L4-L6 Feeding: May-June
6. Pupation: June-July

(finish life cycle)


Budworm injury patterns
- Older *may* feed on old foliage if young foliage is depleted
- crowns of damaged trees appear reddish-brown from June to Sept
- Initial symptoms of defoliation visible in tree tops and at branch tips
- After several years of defoliation -- reduced cones, growth loss, top kill or mortality (esp. immature/suppressed trees)


## Western spruce budworm
BC's most important defoliator
- Focuses on Douglas-fir
	- Common-name misleading

Outbreak first recorded 1909, Southern Vancouver Island near Victoria
- Apparent increase in frequency, severity, and distribution during past century
- Decreasing outbreak intervals, increasing outbreak duration
- Fire suppression
- Climate change



### Fire suppression (retake notes for all of this for fuck sakes):
- Remove low intensity ground fires
- Fewer ground fires allow establishment of dense understory
	- Shade tolerant douglas-fir saplings
- When outbreak populations deplete overstory foliage, they drop into the understory
- increased food supply sustains large populations
	- Outbreaks persist for longer priods


WSBW outbreak range shift

Observational evidence:
- Apparent northward shift during 3 most recent outbreak periods
- Between 1994 and 2011, epidemic infestations detected further north than previous records
- real or atefact?

Emperical evidence:
- Aerial overview survey data
- Centroids
- Determined effective latitude (Latitiude + elevation/122 m) for each centroid
	- Effective latitude accounts for variation in climatic conditions associated with both latitude and elevation
	- 122 m in elevation = 1 degree of latitude
	- Lets us figure out effective latitude


Hypothesis: The northward range shift is a consequence of a climate change-induced shift in optimal synchrony between larval emergence and Douglas-fir bud burst.


Shifting synchrony
- converging synchrony at the highest effective latitudes
- Stable synchrony at moderate effective latitudes
- Diverging synchrony at lower effective latitudes


### past/present outbreaks
### changes in outbreak characteristics
### Control efforts

- BTK Application (biological insectisides)
- 61,966 ha treated in 2008
- Treatment priorities based on:
	- Predicted defoliation
		- Based on aerial surveys and ground assessments of larval populations
	- Potential for stands to recover
	- Stand value (investment)
	- Stand structure
		- Potential for understory to maintain populations
	- Wildlife habitat
	- Recreation/aesthetic values
