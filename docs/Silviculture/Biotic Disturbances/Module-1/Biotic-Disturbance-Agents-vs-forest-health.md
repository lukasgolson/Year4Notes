# Biotic Disturance Agents VS Forest Health
## Outline
* Forest disturbances abiotic versus biotic
* "Forest health" in the headlines
* Forest health: what it really means


"Healthy" forests require change or [[disturbance]]
- Insects and diseases have much greater impacts than wildfire
- Disturbance annually affects many thousands of hectares
- High public profile
	- "Forest Health"

## Biotic disturbances and "forest health" in the news:
- the emerald ash borer
- Forest diseases in the news: Dutch elm disease
- Sirex Wood Wasp
	- Lays eggs and a packet of fungi and enzymes in sapwood
- Sudden oak death
	- Fungi pathogen
- Spruce beetle
	- Massive impacts to Alaska nad the Yukon
- Chestnut Blight
	- Geneticists have been trying to fix this issue by introducing genes from Asian Chestnut
- Mountain Pine Beetle


## Forest health: A closer look
- One of the most widely used terms in ecosystem management
- Often in the news
- Associated with:
	- Air pollution
	- Invasive species
	- Wildfires
	- Insect outbreaks
	- Powerful personal imagery
	- Connects fragility of "health" with ecosystems
	- Misused and abused


Healthy or unhealthy:
Natural Forest:
- In Timber supply area...
	- Pest (unhealthy)
- In protected area...
	- natural disturbance (healthy)
- Intensively managed forest:
	- No pest impacts
	- Meets management objectives, but...
	- Limited in all aspects of ecological function

## Pathogens
- Can cause disturbances by disrupting tree physiological processes which can result in reduced growth or mortality
- They can attack tree roots, stems, branches, foliage, and the vascular system

### Dont always kill trees, they can also reduce tree growth
- Pathogens can reduce tree growth by reducing leaf area and decreasing photosynthesis
- Also steal resources from the host
- Cause tree deformities, which weakens host


## 50 WAYS TO KILL A TREE
- Disurpting water transport by blocking vascular system
- Kill roots and cause major structural damage
- Girdle stems, killing the living tissues of trees




# Forest Health: A Functional Definition
- Values create conflicts!
- Need a definition without human expectations:
A working definition:
- Forest ecosystems are healthy when their underlying ecological processes operate within a natural range of variability, so that on any temporal or spatial scale, they are dynamic and resilient* to disturbance

* If an ecosystem is resistant to disturbance and returns to a similar pre-disturbance state, it is considered resilient

## Warming and forests: The conundrum
Increased productivity but increased biotic and abiotic disturbances


## Disturbance vs C dynamics in Canada's forests
- large insect impacts in recent years
- Insects greater than fire + harvesting
- Significant impacts on C dynamics
- Biotic disturbance creates carbon source



## Disturbance vs C dynamics: The Mountain Pine Beetle Example
Modelling C dynamics in forests through time as a result of disturbance
- Harvesting
- Fire-caused mortality, fuel consumption
- MPB-caused mortality
Project growth of forests in western Canada post disturbance to assess changes in C balance


Mountain Pine Beetle
- 270 Mt C to atmosphere
- Equilavent to 5 yrs of emissions from Canadian transportation sector
- Conversion of BC forests from C sink to source
- Unprecedented outbreak: potential feedback to global climate system


## Mitigation options in the forest sector
- Increase or maintain forest area
	- Reduce deforestation and mitigate disturbance, increase afforestation
- Increase stand-level carbon density
	- Increase use of partial harvest systems, eliminate residue burning, reduce regeneration delays, species selection, mitigate disturbance
- Increase stored carbon in products, reduce emissions through product substitution and bioenergy
	- Promote longer-lived products, building materials, recycling, biofuels from residues, salvage, plantations
- Increase landscape-level carbon density
	- Lengthen rotations (where appropriate), increase conservation areas, **protect against disturbance**
