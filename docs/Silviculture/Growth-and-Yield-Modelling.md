Important for silviculture because there is terminology we need to use, and tools allow us to predict and understand what our treatments will do.



## Growth and yield modelling aims to answer:
- What yield can be expected from a particular species or mixture on a particular site?
- What kind of treatments should be used to achieve particular objectives?
- What has gone wrong? What yield should we see on a particular site?
- How should tese treatments be designed?

## How is this done?
- Simulation of alternatives to pick the "best" option


## What is needed for reliable models?
- A lot of data


G&Y is very important for silvicultural prescriptions/plans

## Growth and yield terminology
### Quadratic mean diameter
- Measure of central tendency
- If every tree is treated the same in the average, then the measurement is not as representative of total volume per hectare
- Weighted towards larger trees
	- Better proxy for tree volume


### Volume Yield
Quanityt of wood or biomass at a particular point in time
- For example:
	- Volume yield per ha - m3/ha or m3 ha-1
	- Biomass in kg per ha - kg/ha or kg ha-1

### Growth/increment
- Change in stand quantity over time
	- For example:
		- Diameter growth per year


### Mean Annual Increment (MAI)
- DBH divided by age
- A tree aged 20 years with a DBH of 30 cm has a MAI of:
	- 30 cm / 20 years = 1.5 cm/yr
- Can also be used with volume


### Period Annual Increment (PAI)
- Average growth over a defined period
	- Usually last over the 5 or 10 last years
		- E.g. diameter growth
		- E.g. stand volume growth

### Current Annual Increment (CAI)
- Growth in the most recent year
	- E.g. Basal Area increment in 2020 (cm2)
	- E.g. Diameter increment in 2020 (cm)


### Basal Area per Tree (BA, m2)


## Growth and yield terminology
Development over time
- Volume yield
- Mean annual increment (MAI)
- Periodic annual increment (PAI)
- Intersection between MAI and PAI indicates point at which stand can be harvested





Stem density = number of trees per HA
- More measures of density available


## Scale of modelling


Model classification
- Whole stand models
	- Yield tables

- Size class models
	- Based on distribution of diameter classes
		- The number of trees in each class is based on empirical data
		- Each diameter class is based on an average tree
	- Growth and volume is calculated by diameter class

- Individual tree models
	- Single tree models / tree list models
	- Distance dependent / Distance independent


- Whole stand models
