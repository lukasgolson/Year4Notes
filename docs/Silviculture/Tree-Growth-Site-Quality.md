## How to select trees for site index measurements?

Vigor: Dominant and co-dominant
- Normal growth

Obsolete: Predominant height
- Based on tallest 100 trees / ha
	- Used for site index

Select trees based on top height
- Average height of the 100 trees / ha with the largest DBH



Tree growth as an indicator of site quality:
Calculating site index with the site curve method:
- Top Heigght: 52 m
- Average DBH-age: 75
- Site Index = 41



Limitations of site index:
- Most useful in even0aged, single species conifer stands
	- Crown shape affects height measurements
	- more than 30 years of DBH-age needed


Note of caution:
Site index usually does not include a measure of uncertainty (confidence interval) but there are many sources of variability:
- Selection of trees and variability within the stand
- Measurement errors
- Uncertainty of growth curves
- Low sample size



### Site quality assessment with indicator plants
- Predict site index with understory vegetation
- In BC, supported through the BEC system (SIBEC)
- Measure of uncertainty provided


### Growth intercept method:
- For stands between 3 years and 30 years
	- greater than or equals 3 years of growth
	- Not overtopped
	- Undamaged stems


### Site quality assessment with soil analysis
Predicting site index with soil properties
- Multiple regression equations based on independent site variables
- Labor-intensive
- Useful when no other methods are possible (e.g. in reforestation or plantation forestry)
- Variables that affect water availability most important
- Variables that describe nutrient status are less important


We look for:
- topography -- water shedding / standing water
- Soil texture -- coarse fragments, fine fraction
- Organic matter
