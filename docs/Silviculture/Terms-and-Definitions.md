# Terms and definitions:
- Growing space
	- The space which each plant has available to develop to grow
	- Not only resources (light, water, nutrients), but also physical space
	- Sum of all resources available to an individual tree (the local environment)
- Age class
	- A distinct group of trees or portion of the stand categorized on the basis of chronological age
		- Important stand types defined based on age class:
			- Even-aged: One age class
			- Two-aged: Two age classes
			- Uneven-aged: Three or more age classes
	- Fieldwork typically uses codes
- Cohort
	- An aggregation of trees that have established due to the same disturbance
	- Distinction between age class and cohortL
		- Cohort can include advance regeneration that was present in the understory before the disturbance, so the chronological age of cohorts can vary widely
- Crown class:
	- Describes the relative size and position of a tree's crown within the canopy of a stand
		1. Dominant (D): Large crowns above the rest
		2. Co-Dominant (C): Large crowns but not the tallet; Have a steeper angle getting light
		3. Intermediate (I): Still get direct light from above, very narrow crowns; very squished between Dominant and Co-Dominant
		4. Opressed (O) (Suppressed): Very little light; on their way out

- Stratification:
	- Different species develop complex multi-species and uneven-aged stands seperated into different strata.


Disturbances are the driver of natural stand dynamics:
- Both the end and the beginning
