# Plant size and density
Kyoji Yoda's -3/2 power rule of self-thinning


Average dry weight per plant = Species coefficient X plant density (n/m2)^-3/2


## Stand density and stocking
### Stand density:
- In general, amount of tree vegetation per unit of land
- In silviculture most often defined as stems/ha


### Stocking
Relative measure of stand density
What we find in a stand vs. what we expect
Usually as percentages e.g., 70% of volume, 90% of basal area
Crown competition factor
Stand density index




## Stand density index
Developed in 1933 by Reinecke
- Size-density relationships for 14 forest types
- Plot of:
	- Log of quadratic mean diameter (QMD)
	- Log of No. of trees/acres (TPA)

Maximum density line

LogN = -1.605logD+K


### Interpretation
- Index value is the number of trees in a stand with QMD of 10 in.
- Comparison with max SDI for species
	- On the same site
	- Same provenance
- Each point on the diagram represents a stand

S1: 300
S2: ?



## Stand density management diagrams
- Represent stand development
- Show the relationship of density with QMD, top height, & Volume
- Good for even-aged single species stands
