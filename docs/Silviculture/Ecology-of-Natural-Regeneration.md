What determines regeneration succcess?
- Presence and scale of disturbance
- Seed dormancy
- Seed supply
- Dispersal
- Germination
- Seedbed
- Growth and survival of seedlings


## Dormancy

Length of seed viability varies by species
- *Acer macrophyllum*: A few weeks
- *Pinus contorta*: Up to 10 years on dead trees

What is seed dormancy?
- Not all seeds germinate immediately - even under favorable environmental conditions

Dormancy of seed depends on:
- Genetics/tree species
- Environmental conditions


Why does it make sense for trees to produce dormant seeds?
- Evolutionary adaptation to disturbance regimes


### Types of dormancy?

A: Endogenous or physiological dormancy
1. Embryo dormancy: Most common type for trees in BC
2. Immature embryo dormancy: E.g., Ash species
	- Embryo needs a period of warm/moist conditions for maturation
3. Growth inhibitors in seed coat: Desert plants or those relying on animal digestion

B: Physical dormancy
1. Impermeable to water
2. Low permeability to gases
3. Embryo growth restricted through mechanical resistance



## Germination
Conditions: 15-30 C; moisture; gas exchange; light

1. Hydration: seed swells and seed coat breaks
2. Physiological activation: Conversion of storage materials into sugars, nitrogen compounds, and lipids (fats, hormones, etc.); translocation to the mbryo to fuel growth; respiration increases
3. Embryo growth and emergence: Cell enlargement and division; emergence of seedling

## Seedling growth and survival
- Emerging seedling uses up food supply rapidly
	- Photosynthesis needed for food production
	- Development of foliage
- Water supply is critical for succesful establishment
	- Root growth is then main priority

- Environment
	- Solar radiation
		- Light intensity

		- Flooding
		- Drought
	- Frost
		- Heaving
		- Soil detachment
		- Damage to seedling
	- Site
		- Aspect
		- elevation
		- slope
- Seed supply
	- Seed trees
	- Species
	- Quantity
	- Dispersal
	- Quality/Viability
	- Seed predation



## Seed Supply
Seed dispersal mechanisms
- Airborne, floating on water: small seeds with tufts
- Airborne with large or small wings
- Animal transport without wings: Berry like seeds
- Animal transport: cached or buried

Vegetation regeneration:
- Coppice systems


### Why do seed dispersal distances differ among species?



## Seed bed
Most important function at establishment: Providing moisture
- Too little water: Droguth
	- Damage through failure of the hydraulic system
	- Tolerance is highly species dependent
	- Tolerance related to stomata regulation
	- Starvation
- Too much water - waterlogging
	- Damage through oxygen deprivation
	- Tolerance highly species dependent

Shade:
- Partial shade preferred for germination
- Important in warm-dry BEC subzones
- Reduces moisture loss
- Lowers day-time temperatures
- Cover reduces frost-damage
- However: can reduce growth after establishment


Light depends on:
- Latitude
- Aspect
- Slope

Heat:
- Most proteins denature at 55C
- Seedlings are most affected due to proximity to the ground


## Survival
Seed:Seedling ratio
- Defined as the number of seeds required to produce a successfully established seedling
- Helps to identify the limiting side of the regeneration triangle

Regeneration in gaps:
- Distribution across an opening depends on species, seed supply, seedbed and environment
- Different species can dominate in different locations relative to the distance from the edge


## Key Messages 
- Overcoming dormancy in seeds depends on the type of dormancy 
- Germination and initial establishment is a highly sensitive phase with high mortality 
- Seed supply, seedbed and the environment determine successful regeneration 
- Seed dispersal depends on the physical properties of the seed, as well as on tree height and wind speed 
- The seed:seedling ratio provides a method to identify limiting factors for regeneration success
