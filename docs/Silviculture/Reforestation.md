10 golden rules for reforestation

1.  Protect existing forest first
    -   Reforestation doesn't easily compensate for the losses of
        deforestation
    -   Old- and second-growth, degraded and restored forests are all
        valuable
2.  Work together
    -   Involve local communities / stakeholders with interactive
        participation in every project phase
3.  Aim to maximize biodiversity recovery to meet multiple goals
    -   Restoring biodiversity will maximize carbon sequestration & help
        deliver socio-economic benefits
4.  Select appropriate areas for reforestation
    -   Only target previously forested lands
    -   Connect or expand existing forest
    -   Do not displace activities that will cause deforestation
        elsewhere
5.  Use natural regeneration wherever possible
    -   It can be cheaper and more efficient than tree planting (if
        conditions are suitable)
    -   Works best on lightly degraded sites or those close to existing
        forest
6.  Â OR Plant species to maximize biodiversity AND Use resilient plant
    material
    -   Always plant a mix of species
    -   Use as many natives as possible
    -   Include rare, endemic, and endangered species
    -   promote mutualistic interactions
    -   Avoid invasive species AND
    -   Incorporate appropriate genetic variability
    -   Pay attention to provenance
7.  Plan ahead for infrastructure
    -   Use locally available infrastructure, capacity, and supply
        chain, or build it into the project
    -   Refer to seed standards to ensure max seed quality & process
        efficiency
    -   Provide training and use local knowledge
8.  Learn by doing
    -   Research existing data and perform trials
    -   Adapt management accordingly
    -   Monitor the results beyond project life
    -   Use appropriate indicators according to project goals
9.  Make it pay
    -   Ensure the projects economic sustainability
    -   Income can come from carbon credits, NTFPs, Watershed & cultural
        services
    -   Ensure the economic benefits reach rural and poor local
        communities
