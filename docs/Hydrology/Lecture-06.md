Introduction

Processes at the ground layer:

-   F ---  infiltration
-   L ---   Lateral flow
-   Pe -- percolation
-   Ss -- subsurface flow

Infiltration (F) -- The process by which water arriving at the soil
surface enters the soil.

-    does not show up on the water balance equation but is an important
    intermediary process. 
-   In this course, we also call all processes related to water movement
    in the unsaturated zone infiltration
-   Water moves in the soil via capillary and gravitational forces
    through micropores and macropores

 

Four possibilities for water in the soil:

-   Held in the soil (if moisture is below field capacity (FC))
-   Evaporation back to the atmosphere
-   Percolation downwards to groundwater
-   Reaches a stream via subsurface flow (saturated zone)

 

-   Infiltration rate: rate at which water enters the soil from the
    surface; decreases as 0v increases
-   water input rate: rate at which water arrives at the surface
-   Infiltration capacity: maximum rate at which infiltration can occur
-   Cumulative infiltration: accumulated depth of water infiltrated over
    a given time period. Equal to the integral of infiltration rate over
    that period
-   Ponding: accumulation of water in the surface when w(t) is igher
    than f(t)
-   Depth of ponding: depth of water that is ponding
