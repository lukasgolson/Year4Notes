Runoff Processes

Runoff within the water & energy balances

-   D -- Direct precipitation
-   O -- Overland Flow
-   Ss -- Subsurface flow

 

Water balance:

-   Falls under Q; is an intermediary process

Energy Balance:

-   Kinetic energy (E\_(k))
-   Potential energy (gravitational potential, pressure potential,
    matric potential, osmotic potential)

 

Fundamentals of runoff

-   Importance:
    -   Directly related to erosion
    -   System responses to precipitation are key to establish flooding
        risk
    -   Initiator of landslides
    -   Directly related to water quality

In humid areas, annual precipitation is disposed of approximately as
shown by the percentages listed.

Surface stormflow leaves the small basin within minutes, whereas some
baseflow may be retained within the soil mantle for years.

Q = P - ET

-   P = 100%
-   ET = 67%
-   Q = 33%
    -   23% baseflow
    -   8% subsurface flow
    -   2% surface stormflow

 

Subsurface Flow

-   "A runoff generating mechanism operating in most upland terrains"
-   Occurs when water moves laterally down a hillslope through soil
    layers or permeable bedrock to contribute to the storm hydrograph
-   In humid environments and steep terrain with conductive soils,
    subsurface flow may be the main mechanism of storm runoff generation
-   Subsurface flow rate is highly dependent on hydraulic conductivity

micropore (matrix) flow

-   Upward and downwards flow

macropore flow

-   Downward flow only

Overland flow

 

Infiltration-excess overland flow

-   Most likely in arid and semiarid landscapes where vegetation
    densities and infiltration rates are low, or in disturbed areas
    -   Hortonion overland flow

 

Saturation-excess overland flow

-   Develops where soil becomes saturation by perennial groundwater
    table rising to the surface or by lateral or vertical percolation
    above an impeding horizon
-   Tends to dominate quickflow in thickly vegetated landscapes with
    thin soils, high water tables, and long gentle concave hillslopes
-   Subsurface flow and saturation overland flow might both be
    simultaneously important

Variable source area

-   Because of temporal and spatial variation of zones generating
    subsurface stormflow, the terms variable source area concept and
    dynamic watershed concept were created.
    -   The flow of water in a stream at any given moment is under the
        influence of a dynamic, expanding or shrinking source area
-   The area actively involved in producing quickly varies from less
    than 1% to more than 50% in extreme storms.
    -   Stormflow & source area will increase at the beginning &
        decrease at the end of a storm / snowmelt event
        -   Caused by subsurface flow & channel expansion / shrinkage

Overview of runoff processes

 

Variable Source Area Hydrology

Variable Source Area Hydrology is the concept that the majority of
runoff exiting a watershed is driven by a relatively small portion of
the watershed. The abundance of these runoff generating sources may
increase and decrease depending on temporal and spatial variability.

Factors that affect runoff

-   Surface and bedrock topography
-   Soil depth and compaction
-   Vegetation type & abundance
    -   Higher vegetation = lower soil moisture
-   Antecedent soil moisture
-   Precipitation form, intensity, duration, distribution
-   Flow pathway: matrix vs. macropores
-   Spatial distribution and occurrence of geomorphic features (e.g.,
    deep alluvial valley bottoms, degree of convergence, etc.
-   Watershed characteristics: circularity, drainage density, slope,
    etc.

We'll use the constant slope method

 

 

Constant slope method by Hewlett & Hibbert (1967)

-   Authors felt that all other methods have the limitation of being
    completely arbitrary
-   Examined hydrograph events from \~200 water-years of record
    collected on fifteen small forested watersheds
-   Determined that a line projected from the beginning of any stream
    rise at a slope of 0.05 cubic feet per second per square mile per
    hour until it intersected the falling side of the hydrograph would
    be satisfactory for separating streamflow into quick and delayed
    flow

"Old" and "new" water

-   75% of quickflow is pre-event water on average worldwide
-   There's water that is standing still in the watershed, not moving,
    happy
    -   Rain comes and makes it all connected and flow to the outlet
    -   I.e., the rain pushes the water that was already there out of
        the watershed
-   Isotopic signature: ratio of stable or unstable isotopes of
    particular elements
    -   Can be used to determine old and new water under the following
        assumptions:
        -   Groundwater and baseflow have a single isotopic
            concentration
        -   Rain or meltwater have a single isotopic concentration which
            is significantly different from that of groundwater and
            baseflow
        -   Vadose water is either same isotopic composition as
            groundwater or makes a negligible contribution to streamflow

 

The seperation of streamflow into "old" and "new" components is based on
the following mixing equation:

CtQt = CoQo + CnQn

Where:

-   C is the concentration of the isotope in the water
-   Q is the flow rate (volume per time unit)
-   The subscripts o, n, and t respectively refer to the old, new, and
    total components of flow.
    -   Given that:
        -   Qt = Qo + Qn
