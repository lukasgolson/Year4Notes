    the glossary.

Watershed concept

Definition

-   The area that appears on the basis of topography to contribute all
    the water that passes through a given cross section of a stream
-   An area of land with a topograpic divide that collects rain and
    snow, discharging most of this water to a stream, river or other
    water body.
-   Synonyms: basin, drainage basin, catchment

Why is the Fraser river water dirtier than the Thompson river?

Silt / sediment that is produced from the flow throughout mountains.

Factors that influence watershed characteristics

A number of factors affect the way water and sediment move from upland
areas to the stream and from there to its terminus.

-   Climate
-   Topography
-   Geology
-   Vegetation
-   Human intervention

Basic parameters

-   Area (ha or km\^2)
-   Shape, topography, slope
-   Elevation
-   Land use
-   Stream discharge
-   Soil characteristics
-   Road network

Stream orders

Horton, Strahler, Shreve

Strahler: Starts at 1, when two 1's join together, it becomes 2. When
two 2's come together, it becomes 3, etc.

Stream types:

-   Perennial: Flowing all the time regardless of season

-   Intermittent: Always full in the rainy season, always dry in the
    summer

-   Ephemeral: Goes dry when it doesn't rain

-   Influent: Losing water into the ground

-   Effluent: Gaining water from the ground

-   Bedrock controlled: Rocky

-   alluvial: more wide

-   Headwater / middle-order / lowland

Response factors affected by watershed characteristics

-   Discharge
-   Response speed
-   Water velocity
-   Flood risk
-   Sediment load
-   Water availability
-   Ecosystems and habitats

Two types of watersheds:

-   Boring
-   Crazy

Hydrologic cycle

Precipitation (496 km3/y) == evaporation (496 km3/y) \#\# Processes *
Precipitation * Evaporation \* Evapotranspiration \* Melt runoff *
Submlimation * Percolation \* Groundwater flow \* Streamflow *
Infiltration * Overland flow \* Condensation \#\# Storage \* Groundwater
* Snow & Glaciers * Lake \* Vegetation \* Stream \* Ocean \* Atmospheric
Water

Water balance equation

P + G\_(in) - (Q + ET + G\_(out)) = ΔS Q = P - ET ± ΔS (simplified) Q =
P - ET (Ultra-simplified)

P = precipitation G\_(in) = groundwater Q = stream outflow ET =
evapotranspiration G\_(out) = groundwater out S = storage
