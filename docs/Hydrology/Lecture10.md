Rating Curves

-   Empirical relationship between state and discharge
-   Less time consuming than other methods
-   Applicable to streams where stage is easy to measure
-   Assumptions: stable channel bed, steady flow (constant velocities)

Q = a(h - h₀)\^(b)

\^(Where h = stage, H)\_(⁰)\^(= stage of no flow, a and b = empirical local parameters)

\^(Weirs and flumes)

-   Pre-calibrated structures for small watersheds (\< 800 ha)
-   Weirs and flumes: stable cross section; known empirical relationship
    between stage and discharge

Ideal conditions for installation:

-   Straight channel
-   Channel constriction (not expansion)
-   Stable bed and banks
-   Little or no overbank flow
-   Single channel
-   No backwater influence (tributary, estuary, ice, debris)
-   Little flow turbulence
-   Look for natural weirs

Dilution gauging

Method of gauging streams that have a high amount of turbulence and/or a
very inconsistent cross-sectional area (e.g., most mountain streams)

-   Based on the proportional relationship between electric conductivity
    and concentration of tracers in water
    -   Typical tracers: common salt, rhodamine dye
    -   Very accurate if stream reach properly chosen
    -   Reach (section between injection and measurement) should be
        approximately 25 times as long as stream width, with no channels
        entering or splitting away from it.
    -   Sufficient turbulence is required to properly mix the solution
    -   All dilution gauging requires the use of a tracer measurable at
        low concentrations
    -   Tracer should not react with anything in the stream or be
        harmful to the environment

Common tracers

-   Salt (NaCl)
    -   Inexpensive
    -   Readily available
    -   Simple to measure as electrical conductivity
-   Fluorescent dyes (e.g., rhodamine)
    -   Detectable to parts per billion
    -   Can assess mixing visually
    -   Requires expensive fluorometers to measure

Empirical Equation

Manning's equation

Q = V X A

V = 1/n(R\_(h)^(⅔)S^(½))

V = average velocity in stream cross-section \[m/s\]

R\_(h) = hydraulic radius (m) = A / WP

A = Cross-sectional area m²

WP = wetted perimeter \[m\]

s = energy slope (approximated by water surface slope) \[m m⁻¹\]

n = roughness coefficient

Applicability of Manning

-   When there is no gauging station
-   When peak discharge is beyond highest measured stage
-   When peak discharge of previous flood is of interest
