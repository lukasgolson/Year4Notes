4.  Illustrate the direction (positive/negative) and relative magnitude
    of local energy exchanges during various seasons and at night/day.
5.  Explain how the presence or absence of vegetation affects the local
    energy balance and each of its energy components.
6.  Define with your own words, and put into context, all the terms in
    the glossary.

Electromagnetic radiation

-   Kinetic energy: Due to motion of an object
-   Chemical energy: As in gasoline, oil, coal, natural gas
-   Nuclear energy: As in nuclear reactor fuel
-   Radiant energy: As in sunlight
-   Heat energy: As in hot water, molten metal
-   Electircal energy: As in a light bulb, electric motor

Radiant energy

Most things are powered via the sun.

Can travel via vaccuum.

Can be simplified into shortwave and longwave radiation. \* Shortwave
radiation: Includes wavelengths in the near infrared, visible, and near
ultraviolet sections. Mainly the sun. \* Longwave radiation: Mostly in
the infrared, longwave radiation is related to the emission of heat.
Heat.

Solar Radiation: \* Total solar irradiance (previously and erroneously
called solar constant), is the average energy from the sun at the
Earth's top of atmosphere, measured perpendicularly to the radiation.

Equations and components:

Energy Balance Equation

Day: QE = S + D - aK + L⤓ - L⤒ ± Lh ± Sh ± Ch Night: QE = L⤓ - L⤒ ± Lh ±
Sh ± Ch

Terms

Direct solar radiation (S) Diffuse radiation (D) Incoming shortwave
radiation / Insolation (K) = S + D Albedo (a) Outgoing shortwave
radiation (aK, K⤒) Net shortwave radiation (K\*) Incoming Longwave
Radiation (L⤓) Outgoing Longwave Radiation (L⤒) Net Radiant Energy (R)
Latent Heat Flux (Lh)

Forms of energy transfer

-   Radiative: emitted by objects with temperature \> 0 K (All objects
    emit long-wave radiation, once it reaches a certain temperature, it
    might start releasing short-wave radiation) (K, Incoming /
    outcoming L)
-   Convection: Vertical mixing of fluids (S\_(h))
-   Conduction: molecule to molecule contact (C\_(h), S\_(h))
-   Latent heat: energy absorbed or released during a phase change
    (L\_(h)), when water evaporates or condenses

Component particularities

-   Albedo for different land uses

Latent Heat: \* Energy consumed or released to change the temperature
(vibration state) of water or another substance.

Sensible heat: \* Molecules from hotter object in direct contact with
colder object will transfer heat via conduction.

Local energy balance

-   A positive + sign during a spring day means heat gains for the
    snowpack, which is either increasing its temperature or melting.
-   A negative sign during a spring day means heat losses for the
    snowpack, which is either decreasing its temperature or refreezing.
