Fundamentals of snow

Importance

-   on average, 60% of Northern Hemisphere has snow in mid-winter
-   Major source of drinking water in Canada
-   Snow is typically in mountains and so are most of our forests
-   BC -- flooding (rain on snow) resulting in increased erosion rates
    and structural damages

Definitions

-   Snowpack: accumulated snow on the ground at a time of measurement
-   Snowfall: precipitation that falls as snow
-   Snow water equilavent (SWE) amount of liquid water present in a
    snowpack
-   Peak SWE (maximum SWE recorded prior to melting)
-   Snow depth (d) thickness of a snowpack \[m\]; perpendicular to mean
    sea level
-   Snow density: mass of snow in a given volume
-   Snow cover: fraction of area covered by snow \[%\]
-   Snow melt: change of snow to liquid water resulting from energy
    inputs \[mm / day\]
-   Snow ablation: loss of mass from a snowpack by the combination of
    wind transport, sublimation, and/or melt \[mm / day\]

General

-   New snowfall typically has a density of around 100 kg / m³
-   Winter snowpack's typically have mean densities between 200 and 300
    kg m³
-   The density of a snowpack reflects the characteristics of the
    various snowfall events and various processes such as snow
    compaction and snow melt and refreeze cycles
-   SWE can be calculated by knowing snow density and depth

 

 

 

Phases of snowmelt

1.  warming phase: Steady temp increase until snowpack is isothermal at
    0C
2.  Ripening phase: Melting occurs but water is retained in snowpack
    until Isothermal (0C) snowpack at the end of the phase cannot retain
    more liquid water.
3.  Output phase: further inputs of energy produce water output. 

Processes might not be steady; snow melting in the surface releases
water that percolates through the snowpack, refreezes, and raises
temperature by releasing latent heat.

Snowpack temperature varies during the day.

 

Snowpack is ripe when it is primed to release liquid water: when
snowpack temperature is 0C and the liquid-water-holding capacity of the
snowpack has been reached. Any additional input of either energy or
liquid water will then be released from the bottom of the pack.

 

Factors influencing snowpack

-   Energy: Higher energy == higher melting
-   Slope: There is a larger snowpack in the North, because the South
    slope has greater shortwave energy from the sun and a higher
    melt-rate
-   Logging: There is more shortwave energy entering the snowpack
    because of less cover from shortwave radiation from vegetation,
    trees, etc. decreasing overall snowpack .
    -   When combined with slope, we can see that there will be even
        greater impact on the South slope.
-   Vegetation: Canopy density & type also impacts snowpack. There is
    more energy under spruce than there is under pine. Likely to be more
    energy under deciduous than coniferous trees.

 

Ablation

-   As forest cover decreases, interception decreases (more accuulation)
    and melt rates increase (faster snow dissapearance).
-   Cases where greater melt rates occur under a denser forest have been
    termed "radiative paradox", where increases in long-wave radiation
    with increasing canopy cover are greater than corresponding
    decreases in shortwave radiation.
    -   These conditions are likely to occur with low atmospheric
        emissivities, high snow albedos, and low solar elevations, are
        more common on shaded, poleward facing slopes.

R\_(n) = K↓ - K↑ + L↓ - L↑ 

-   Forest cover increases \>\>\> K\* decreases \>\>\> L↑ loss
    decreases \>\>\> L↓ gain from the forest canopy increases.
-   R\_(n) is minimum at around 20% canopy cover, but increases at dense
    forest canopy conditions because of the much higher L↓ radiation
    gains emitted by the forest canopy.
-   R\_(n) is still highest at 0% forest cover (open) with large input
    from K\* radiation.

Snow measurements

-   Lysimeters
-   Ultrasonic snow depth sensors
-   Snow pillows
-   Remote sensing
    -   Satellite optical measurements -- snow cover
    -   Satellite passive microwave -- SWE
    -   Satellite active microwave -- SWE
    -   Hyperspectral radiometers -- snow grain size
    -   Airborne gamma -- SWE
    -   Airborne LiDAR -- Snow depth
    -   Satellite optical measurements -- snow albedo
    -   Limitations:
        -   Low spatial resolutions
        -   High cost
        -   Specializing processing (LiDAR or microwave)
        -   Low accuracy (gross empirical indirect estimations) E.g.,
            SWE from microwave
