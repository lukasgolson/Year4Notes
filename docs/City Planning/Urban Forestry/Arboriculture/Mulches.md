Purpose

Mulches go around the base of a tree or other plants. "mimics" litter
layer in a forest.

-   Helps retain moisture
-   Improves infiltration/reduces runoff
-   Reduces competition from weeds
    -   Blocks light from below and keeps seeds from germinating or from
        landing.
-   Can create a lovely seed bed.
-   Doesn't help as much as people think (probably tons of herbicide
    being laid down where weeds are not present)
-   Creates a visual boundary for trees (helps because people seem to
    like to mow down saplings)
-   Moderates temperatures

 

Concerns

Woodchips have a C/N ratio of 1:400; compost of 1:20; What does this
mean?

-   A mulch with high C/N ratio can cause nitrogen deficiency,
    especially if mixed in the soil
-   Materials with lots of cellulose tend to have a higher C/N ratio
-   The C/N ratio of wood chips will decrease as a mulch is aged
-   The fineness of the material and extent of mixing play a large role
    in the influence of C/N ratio

 

Research shows this isn't usually an issue.
