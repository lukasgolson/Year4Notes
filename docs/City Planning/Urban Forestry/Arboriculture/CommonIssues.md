Issue 1: Not enough soil

When there isn't enough soil, the tree will reach the carrying capacity
of the available soil.

-   Stunted growth
-   Reduced foliage
-   Trees take on the characteristics of old trees (rough bark, etc.)
-   Death

Solutions:

-   Special underground planting spaces
    -   Vaulted sidewalks;
        -   Sidewalk is suspended about 10 cm's above open soils
    -   smaller, modular versions of vaulted sidewalks
        -   i.e., Silva cells
-   Special "compactable" soils (structural soils, skeletal soils)
    -   Modern construction techniques compact soils pretty hard to
        prevent pavings from sinking or shifting
-   Access tunnels to larger soil areas
    -   Tunnels to access nearby parks?
-   Design solutions
    -   Maximize space with design, both above ground and below ground
-   High quality soils provide more resources

Issue 2: Soil doesn't drain

Presence of "Gleying": Blueish-gray color that indicates low oxygen
conditions in the soil (reduced iron). Also visible by water not
draining from the soils or indicator plant species.

-   Many trees intolerant of poor drainage.

Indicator plant species

Unlike in "natural" environments, such as forests, species are mostly
managed under a city context. Indicator plant species are not used by
whether or not they're present in an area, rather, they're used by the
conditions in which they are present.

 

Yews are a good indicator for poor drainage

-   Leaves turn brown in poor drainage situations

Solutions

-   Remove cause of poor drainage if possible
-   Install sub-surface drainage to an outlet
-   Use plants tolerant of poor drainage
