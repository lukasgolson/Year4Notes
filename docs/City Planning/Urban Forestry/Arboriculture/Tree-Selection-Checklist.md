 

Tree Selection Checklist 

The checklist below represents most of the considerations that need to
be taken into account when selecting a tree for a particular location.
You may have other considerations (for example, by-laws that you must
comply with, economic restrictions, or stakeholder preferences) that
will influence tree selection for any given situation. However, by
considering the items below there is considerably less chance for design
failure due to poor species selection. The background information
required for making tree selection decisions can be extensive. 

Soil Conditions at Exact Planting Location 

-   Does the tree tolerate the soil drainage of the site? 
-   Does the tree tolerate the soil pH? 
-   If the soil is compacted (or will be in the future, say by
    pedestrian traffic) will health/growth be unacceptably impaired? 
-   Is the tree susceptible to damage by deicing salt (consider sources
    from runoff and plowed snow and species tolerances)? 
-   Is there enough soil volume to support this type of tree? 
-   When the tree matures, are there adequate "escape zones" for roots? 
-   Can the tree tolerate any unusual drainage characteristics of the
    site? e.g., receiving excessive water or insufficient water because
    of surface drainage patterns. 

Climate and Microclimate 

-   Is the tree reliably cold hardy (match hardiness zones and
    species/cv.)? 
-   Does the tree tolerate the climate conditions that are predicted for
    60 years in the future? 
-   Can the tree tolerate the heat at the site or in the region? 
-   Will the tree get enough water after it is established? Consider
    species requirements, climate, and site. 
-   Does the tree tolerate the site's sun or shade patterns? 
-   Are there any microclimates that might affect blooming etc. or
    create unexpected warm or cold conditions? 
-   Are there any streetlights that might disrupt dormancy? Is the
    species susceptible to this? 

Maintenance and Transplanting Concerns 

-   Is the plant susceptible to any diseases or insects that will cause
    serious problems (either for the tree or for people) if not
    treated? 
-    Will the tree require extensive structural pruning when young? If
    so, do you have resources to insure this pruning takes place? 
-   Is the tree weedy or invasive? Are there nearby open areas that
    might be affected? 
-   Will fruits or leaves cause maintenance problems (tracking into
    buildings, damaging cars or paint, slippery sidewalks, attract
    hornets)? If so, can you handle these issues? 
-   Does the tree have thorns or spines or is it toxic to humans or
    animals? (Especially important in areas with children, livestock,
    near walkways, or on plants that need frequent pruning.)  \_\_  Is
    the tree available in the nursery trade? If not, how will you source
    it? 
-   Does the tree transplant readily? If not, can you make appropriate
    adjustments? 
-   Does the tree tend to produce root suckers? Can these be maintained,
    avoided, or tolerated? 
-   Does the tree produce excessive allergens (pollen, for example)? 
-   Does the tree produce allelopathic compounds? If so, are any
    susceptible plantings nearby? 

Ecological Functions and Interactions 

-   Does the tree appropriately further your goals for species diversity
    in the community? 
-   Does the tree provide food for wildlife or habitat? How does this
    fit in with your goals? 
-   Are there opportunities to plant rare or unusual species at this
    site? If yes, should they be considered instead? 
-   If the plant is non-native, is it likely that propagules will be
    transmitted to nearby "wild" areas? Is this a concern? 
-   Have you screened the plant for invasiveness potential? 

Aesthetics & Culture 

-   Does the tree align with community preferences or cultural needs or
    values? 
-   Does the tree have cultural significance or use (food source, for
    example) that might affect its interactions with people? 
-   Is the tree's winter appearance appropriate in terms of function and
    aesthetics? (evergreen, deciduous, bark, etc.) Consider screening,
    solar gain in buildings, etc. 
-   Does the tree have attractive fall color? 
-   Does the plant have other especially ornamental characteristics?
    flowers? bark? Will they show to advantage in this site? 
-   Does the plant serve as a backdrop for other plantings? (e.g.,
    evergreen trees behind flowering tree). 
-   Is uniformity with neighboring trees important? (consider a cultivar
    if it is) 

Tree Size and Form 

-   Is the tree's mature size (height & spread) appropriate for the
    site? (think at least 60 years ahead)
-   Is the tree's form appropriate? (e.g., low or pendulous branches,
    columnar, wide spreading) 
-   Does the tree form accommodate nearby pedestrian and vehicular
    traffic (can clearances be maintained)? 
-   Does the plant fulfill its intended form-related or structural
    functions (shading parking lot or street, screening, can be viewed
    from a window, etc..)? You must know function to consider this. 
-   Does the tree create exceptionally dense shade? If so, does this fit
    with other site features or design intent? 
-   When the tree matures, will it adversely impact other plants in the
    vicinity? Is this acceptable? 

Overall Considerations 

-   Are there many other sites where this tree could be planted? If yes,
    is there a "higher" use for this site? 
-   Is the cultivar you selected critical for any of the issues examined
    above? Or can substitutions be allowed? Would a seedling be useful
    or appropriate in this situation? 
-   Are there special goals or functions that the tree will be expected
    to provide that relate to species selection and aren't covered
    above?
