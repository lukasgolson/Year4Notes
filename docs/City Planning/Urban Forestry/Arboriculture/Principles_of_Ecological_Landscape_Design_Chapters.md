Ecological Landscape Design reading by Beck (2013).

Chapter 2

In a natural setting, plant species grow in populations (groups of
individuals). Populations are never static and uniform, as they are
diverse in age, size, height, and genetic tolerance to climate
conditions. This allows populations to be resilient by making them
dynamic. Designers should consider planting dynamic populations of
different individuals and cultivars with varying age groups and
characteristics.

Populations of different species grow together as communities. Mimicking
locally seen communities would allow for a dynamic landscape that
settles into the site quickly by pruning off unsuccessful species over
time and establishing those that are.

Key Takeaways

-   Create planting strategies that complement or work together with
    spatial processes seen in ecosystems.
-   Integrate genetic diversity into the planting strategy to create
    "evolvable" populations that are diverse.
-   Consider planting plant individuals of various age and size groups.
-   Incorporate the concept of intraspecific competition to allow
    self-thinning of stands.
-   Encourage populations to change through time.
-   Create planting strategies that build plant communities.
