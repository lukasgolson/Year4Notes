Introduction

How can we work with trees in our urban plantings?

-   Traditional pattern is  as an art-form: Clear everything and start
    over as a clean slate. Widely spaced trees with grass in-between
    them.
-   Can we incorporate and manage what's there?
-   Arboriculture affects the structural components of an ecosystem

 

Lecture 3 focuses on:

-   Plants and the environment
-   Genotype and cultivars
-   Plant nomenclature

Plants and the environment

Trees can't flee from danger; they're rooted!

-   Adapted techniques to deal with this: shedding leaves, etc.
-   IMPORTANT: The plant environment supports plants
    -   genotype X environment = phenotype
        -   Artists often treat plants like "widgets" (static,
            mechanical objects)
    -   Growth of the current year is affected by that of previous years
        (bud set).
-   The plant and its environment are part of a larger system that
    performs ecosystem processes

Genotype and cultivars

Genotype X environment = phenotype

Genotype: What are the genetics of your tree?

-   Monoculture bad: taught many times; most recently through the fall
    of nearly all American elms.

Understanding the cultivar:

-   Cultivated variety
-   Must be propagated
    -   Nearly all have very similar if not identical genetic material
    -   Some families, such as oaks, are very difficult to vegetatively
        propagate

Do cultivars reduce genetic diversity? 

-   Directly: Yes
-   Indirectly: No! Genetic diversity might even increase because more
    species can be planted

Plant Nomenclature

When we need to speak specifically about a plant, scientific name should
always be used.

-   especially when specifying species in contracts, schedules, plans.

No single authority over scientific names. Different organizations might
accept a different authority. UBC accepts the names defined by the Royal
Horticultural Society.

Various databases available:

-   Royal horticultural society
-   Canadian Biodiversity Information Facility (CBIF)
-   etc.
