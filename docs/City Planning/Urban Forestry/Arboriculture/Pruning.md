General

-   Removing plant parts
-   Must have a purpose
-   Essential in most planted trees, especially in early stages

Overview

-   Plant response to pruning

-   -   hormonal controls

-   -   predicting response

-   structural pruning of young trees

Why prune? Just a few examples

-   Improve structure, increase strength
-   Reduce or eliminate hazards
-   promote flowering

Plant hormones control plant response

-   Auxins (produced in SAM)
-   cytokinins (produced in roots)
-   Abscisic acid (regulates stomatal closure)
-   Ethelyene (Stress Hormone, ripening)
-   Giberellins (Plant development)

Pruning mainly focuses on cytokinins and ethelyne

Why prune mature trees?

-   Risks reduction
-   Clearance
-   Visibility
-   Utility line conflicts
-   Specialty applications (pollarding, pleaching, espalier)

Managing Pruning of mature trees

Three Pruning Methods/Cuts

-   Heading cuts involve trimming a branch back to a bud. This removes
    the shoot apical meristem and subsequently the auxin hormone signals
    that suppress lateral growth. So basically, heading stimulates
    lateral growth by removing its barriers. Heading cuts are most
    effective on one-two year old branches to either remove a competing
    leader or create hedges. Pollarding is a type of heading where
    branches are cut back annually to the same spot on the tree,
    re-invigorating lateral growth every year.
-   Thinning cuts are the most frequently used cuts in tree pruning. It
    involves trimming a branch to another/parent limb, giving that
    latter branch the terminal role. It is important that the
    to-be-terminal branch must be 1/3 of the diameter of the
    to-be-removed branch. It is also crucial to not damage the root
    collar when making thinning cuts.
-   Bending is technically not a cut. However, it is still a crucial
    part of redirecting plant/branch growth. It involves tying or
    stabilizing a flexible branch or shoot horizontally or vertically,
    altering the auxin gradient of the branch and forcing the branch to
    produce more ethylene, which not only reduces vegetative growth but
    also fuels flower & fruit production. Bending is a topic of interest
    for urban foresters when it comes to creating food forests. \# How
    to Prune Right: The 3-Cut Method Belive it or not, there is a right
    and wrong way to prune a branch. The right way is called the 3-Cut
    Method, and the basic idea is shown below: \[3-cut.png\]

Summary

-   If you can't clearly explain to someone else why a tree should be
    pruned or why a particular plant part should be removed, you should
    not be pruning
-   You need to know your species and your objective before any pruning
    decisions can be made
-   Prune is a balancing act, there is an art to getting it right
-   Good pruning can extend the useful service life of individual trees
    in your urban forest
-   Pruning standards and clear specications are essential for achieving
    quality work
-   There are many specialty types of pruning that are practiced by
    niche horticultural business and professionals
