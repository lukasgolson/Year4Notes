Tree Selection in the Urban Forest

Trees that live a long time in the city is a massive accomplishment.

Selecting the planted tree

-   To supply planting programs
-   New construction or re-designs, improvements, enhancements
-   Street tree replacement
-   Afforestation or reforestation

Three elements that come into play

-   The existing environment
-   The landscape elements
-   Design Intent

Sustainable Site Plan

1.  Assess Site Conditions
2.  Modify & Improve Site Conditions
3.  Plan Site to make best use of site characteristics
4.  Plan site to meet landscape objectives (Design intent)

The Site Assessment

-   Soil Condition
-   Site Contamination
-   Underground Utilities
-   Water Sources
-   Transportation
-   Current Use
-   Stakeholder Preferences
-   Maintenance Staff & Resources
-   Existing Vegetation
-   Sun/Shade Patterns
-   Stormwater Flows
-   Legal Restrictions
-   Land Rights
-   Wildlife Use
-   Special Habitats or Plants
-   Heritage Plants or Artifacts
-   Vistas

Factors in Tree Selection

-   Immediate Location
-   Interactions within the site over time
-   Interactions Beyond the site
-   Urban Forest objectives
-   Logistics

 

Immediate Location

We can take a linear approach; 

-   What are the site conditions?
    -   pH
    -   soil compaction
    -   drainage
    -   etc.
-   Will our trees thrive in the exact location?
    -   Traditional "right plant, right place"

Interactions within the site over time

-   Is there / will there be conflict / competition between species?
    -   Do understory vegetation (i.e., shrubs) have enough sun if the
        canopy matures?

Interactions Beyond The Site

-   Supporting the larger ecosystem
    -   Become aware of what in the local area are some ecosystem needs
        -   Food and shelter for wildlife, pollinators, etc.
        -   Special environments
        -   Migratory stop-over for birds, butterflies
-   Not harming the larger ecosystem
    -   Do not plant invasive species
    -   Research exotic species thoroughly before using
        -   Behavior of species in their native environment, in other
            environments
    -   Invasive species screening protocols
-   What is your biome?
    -   Will plantings naturalize? Will they cause harm?

 

Plant lists and "smart" systems

-   Are useful tools to help you make sense of a complex situation
-   Are useful for generating candidate lists of species
-   Are not a substitute for knowing your species
-   Are not a substitute for a robust design process
-   Are not a substitute for a thorough site assessment

 

 

Summary

-   There are a myriad issues to consider, consider them!
-   You must know your species characteristics and ecological history --
    dig deep before using a species
-   Some sites/locations/climates are extremely limiting
-   You are responsible for not causing ecological harm and need to
    research invasive potential
-   A truly successful species selection decision is a major
    accomplishment and will benefit generations to come
