Basics

Soils make the foundation of urban tree canopy, without good soils

-   Establishment is difficult / poor
-   Growth is  poor
-   Canopy formation is poor

Soils are:

-   A Soil management challenge
-   A Design challenge
-   A Engineering challenge

Urban soils have vastly different challenges from rural soils

-   Principles of soil science are the same, but challenges are
    different.

Soils directly influence tree phenotype.

Soil Volume

-   Urban forest research has tried to answer / address how to deal with
    limited soil volume for trees in cities for many years.
-   Cities have only recently introduced soil volume guidelines.
-   How much soil is required for trees?
    -   Difficult to answer; one variable is the root architecture of a
        tree if it weren't restricted

Soil volume standard for Vancouver Parks Board

  ---------------------------------- ----------------------------------
  Canopy Size                        Minimum Soil Volume

  Large (Maple)                      30 m³ (single tree) 20 m³ (row of
                                     trees)

  Medium (Hornbeam)                  20 m³ (single tree) 15 m³ (row of
                                     trees)

  Small (Snowbell)                   10 m³ (single tree) 5 m³ (row of
                                     trees)
  ---------------------------------- ----------------------------------

How much soil volume is enough?

Charts exist but they assume that trees will "escape" the confines of
these designed or planned soil volumes and send roots out beyond yonder
to collect water and nutrient resources.

Considering the basal area that can be supported by 1 ha of land, we
discover that the soil volume resource per trunk cross-sectional area is
much greater than what is supplied in most urban settings.

Some models for soil volume need is based on water requirements (so that
in a hot, dry climate, greater volumes are needed), but this can lead to
impossibly large soil volumes. 

Estimating root spread

To estimate root spread of a young tree (approximately 8 inches / 20
centimeters in diameter) where there is no impediment to the roots:

1.  Measure trunk diameter (circumference / pi)
2.  Multiply the number by 38

NOTE: There is not much data on large and mature trees.

NOTE: Roots don't extend very far under intact pavement.

Below-ground competition

There is limited space below ground; two things can't occupy the same
place: competition

We need to determine 

-   root location
-   root spread;
-   Root depth;
-   Root interaction with soil
-   Species influence over previous bullet points

NOTE: For very large trees, there is not much actual data available on
root spread.

Root systems are massive on large trees, quantifying them is very
difficult.

How roots interact with compacted soils

-   Important because:
    -   Judgements can't be made under a city context without
        understanding this concept
    -   Necessary to make "judgements" / estimate based upon
        understanding of species
-   Soil is a structural component
-   Soil Strengths:

  ---------- --------------------------
  0.6 MPa    Low Soil Strength
  1.75 MPa   Moderately High Strength
  2.0 MPa    High Strength
  ---------- --------------------------

Roots will follow path of least resistance (POLR)

Allelopathy

Some plants, such as walnut, produces chemicals to gain competitive
advantages. 

-   Walnut roots excrete juglone which inhibits the growth of some other
    plants.
-   Tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea) suppresses the growth of a wide
    variety of tree species.

Another common allelopathic plant in urban settings is tall fescue. This
is a very widely used cool-season turfgrass species (Festuca arundinacea
a.k.a. Schedonorus arundinaceus) . This grass seems to have allelopathic
interactions with a wide range of tree species, supressing growth. Tall
fescue is also host to a mutualistic endophyte that may also contribute
to the production of alleopathic chemicals. Some authors (for example,
Renne et al. 2004) suggest that biochemical recognition among plants may
be adaptive, i,e. that plants may derive an advantage from recognizing
the presence of an aggressive competitor like tall fescue and avoid
investing resources in growth when success is unlikely. There are lots
of different types of tall fescue, there is confusion about the taxonomy
and about the infection rate and resulting interactions of the
endophyte. However, all in all, there is some evidence that this turf
species inhibits growth of many trees beyond simple competition for the
same soil resources. Below ground interactions are very complex,
however, and new science is rapidly emerging. In particular, our
understanding of complex biological interactions is expanding, leading
to new paradigms about everything from soil carbon sequestration to
plant-to-plant communications.

Conflicts & Challenges between roots & people

In many cities, tripping hazards are massive liabilities for cities.

-   Extremely expensive problem when cities are sued
    -   Cities will try to avoid tripping hazards
-   Roots lift sidewalks / cause them to buckle
    -   Cities block / try to prevent roots from growing under sidewalks

Roots need to go somewhere to access soil, nutrients, water. 

 

Solutions:

-   Special underground planting spaces
    -   Vaulted sidewalks;
        -   Sidewalk is suspended about 10 cm's above open soils
            -   Open soils that are loose and uncompacted are placed
                beneath the sidewalk
    -   smaller, modular versions of vaulted sidewalks
        -   i.e., Silva cells
-   Special "compactable" soils (structural soils, skeletal soils)
    -   Modern construction techniques compact soils pretty hard to
        prevent pavings from sinking or shifting
    -   Another example is the Swedish rock system: large rocks are
        installed and soil is washed in and around the rocks. The rocks
        support the pavement
-   Access tunnels to larger soil areas
    -   Tunnels to access nearby parks?
-   Design solutions
    -   Maximize space with design, both above ground and below ground
-   High quality soils provide more resources

 

Root Function

-   Supply water and nutrients to the tree
-   Other physiological functions
-   Building soil structure
    -   Fine root turnover (roots die and new ones grow on a weekly and
        daily basis).
    -   Roots push themselves through soil
-   Improve soil drainage
    -   Through tunnels created by living and dead roots allow water to
        move through the soil underground
-   A whole host of ecosystem services including
    -   Contaminated soil remediation
    -   Storm water filtration
    -   Carbon Sequestration

 

Root Growth Periodicity

Root growth periodicity is the timing of root growth. This is important
because arborists and urban forest planners must know when and where
roots grow every year. 

This root growth is controlled and signaled by the environment, mainly:

-   Soil temperature
-   Soil moisture

Physiological readiness is another critical factor for root growth, as
it is species-dependent. If roots on a tree are removed, it takes time
(38 days or more depending on species) for them to start growing again.
Physiological readiness is essentially how long the tree takes to
recover from the shock to start regrowing roots. 

How far will roots grow in a year? It depends on the place. In Chicago,
trees were observed to grow around 45 cm/year, while in the Virginia
mountains they determined it to be around 1 m/year. In northern Florida,
tree roots can grow 2 m/year!
