Terminology to Know

Risk - the possibility of something undesirable or destructive
happening. In this case, the "risk" of a tree is considered in terms of
dangers to humans. So if a tree falls on a wilderness space far from
people traffic, the risk is considered "low" or even zero.

Failure - a very special, arboriculture-specific term that refers to a
part of a tree breaking off or falling down. A \" branch failed\" means
that a branch has fallen off. A "tree failed" means that the entire tree
fell down.Â 

Defect - A possible characteristic that could lead to tree failure.

Target - anything that might be damaged by a tree failure.
