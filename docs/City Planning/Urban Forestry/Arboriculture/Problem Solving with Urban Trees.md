How roots interact with compacted soils

-   Important because:
    -   Judgements can't be made under a city context without
        understanding this concept
    -   Necessary to make "judgements" / estimate based upon
        understanding of species
-   Soil is a structural component
-   Soil Strengths:

  ---------- --------------------------
  0.6 MPa    Low Soil Strength
  1.75 MPa   Moderately High Strength
  2.0 MPa    High Strength
  ---------- --------------------------

 

Roots will follow path of least resistance (POLR)
