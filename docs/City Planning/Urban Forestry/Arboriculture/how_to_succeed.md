This is/was written by a student who did moderately well in the midterm.
Do not rely on this as the sole pathway to an A+ grade. Rather, use this
guide as a way to supplement your own studying style.

Here are a few tips from your peers on how to best: 1) ace, 2) manage,
and 3) survive this course. Hopefully, you don't end up in the third
scenario.

 

-   Take notes on paper. Paper writing is a good way to make information
    stick. If you prefer taking notes online, try writing them out on
    paper later. 
-   The best note-taking method that I found personally is to write them
    out in paragraph form in your own words. Or at least take bullet
    points during the lectures and then use them to form your sentences.
    Summarizing and synthesizing content can help things make sense and
    discover information gaps. This is especially important because this
    course looks for critical thinking and application, not entirely
    data memorization.
-   Meet up with your fellow students to talk about and/or revisit the
    module materials together. In-person is recommended, but meeting
    online is better than no meeting at all. I discovered many pieces of
    information that I missed during the lectures and readings. Then it
    appeared on the exam!
-   Ask questions to your instructor and TAs! Visit them during their
    office hours/friendly events.
-   Go out for a walk and look at urban trees! Try to apply what you
    learned in your observations. Questions, clarity, and aha-moments
    will surely come up!
-   Use flashcards, online or physical. Creating flashcards helped me
    associate meaning to specific terms.
-   Create a mind map to supplement the previous steps. I find that mind
    maps alone will not solidify knowledge, but using them with
    effective note-taking and peer discussions do help.

 

-   Get good sleep! The more sleep-deprived, the less likely it is for
    information to stick.
