Are cities the same from an ecological perspective?

Urban Ecology

Land Use Classification

Here is what you always include when doing a site description:

1.  Land use classification
    -   'Residential'
    -   'Commercial'
    -   'Green area'
    -   'Industrial'
    -   'Conservation'
2.  The dominant human activity on the site
3.  Variable 1: Urbanization intensity (usually assessed using built
    cover)
    -   The proportion of Impervious Surfaces
        -   0 - 33% built cover = "Sparsely developed"
        -   34 - 66% built cover = "Moderately developed"
        -   67% - 100% built cover = "Highly developed"
4.  Variable 2: human activities - noise, pedestrian/vehicle activities,
    etc.

Rural vs Exurban

Both rural and exurban are sparsely populated areas compared to "urban"
zones. 

Rural - surrounded by agricultural land

Exurban - surrounded by natural habitat ("embedded in a natural habitat
matrix", according to the lecture slides)

Urban Ecology

Urban ecology is the ecology in, of, and for cities.

 

5 Urban Ecology Principles

1.  Cities are ecosystems - urban ecosystems will still have biotic and
    abiotic interactions
2.  Cities are spatially heterogeneous - urban ecosystems will contain
    diverse, multidimensional, and remnant/emerging biota distributed
    heterogeneously across the landscape
3.  Cities are dynamic - urban ecosystems will host various natural
    processes that are heavily reactive to cultural, economic, and
    regional pressures. Closely related to Principle 4.
4.  Cities link human and natural processes - Species richness can be
    affected by regional socioeconomics. Urban effects can
    spill/integrate into surrounding rural/natural areas. When wealth
    correlates with species richness, it is called the Luxury Effect.
5.  Cities will still host/operate ecosystem processes - Nature does not
    stop after a site is developed.

Remember, Biodiversity is...

The variability among living  organisms, from genes to biomes. This 
encompasses diversity within, and among,  species and ecosystems.
(Lecture 5 Slides)

3 Diversity elements

-   Genetic Diversity - Total genetic information of an individual to a
    group of species. Basically the adaptive capacity of a
    species/groups of species
-   Species Diversity - Total number and distribution of species that
    occupy a community
    -   Species richness - number of species
    -   Species evenness - distribution of species
    -   Species diversity can be viewed by: rarity - low abundance or
        endemic to a limited region, or impacts - how one species can
        have a larger footprint on other species than expected.
-   Ecosystem Diversity - Total complexity of an ecosystem
    -   Vertical diversity - \# of trophic levels
    -   Horizontal diversity - \# of species in one trophic level
    -   Ecosystem function - all biological and biogeochemical processes
        that play in a community
