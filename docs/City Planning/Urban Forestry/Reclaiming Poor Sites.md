or soil reclamation - Reclamation -- return to useful purpose -
Rehabilitation -- repair, relative to functions and services -
Replacement -- adapt for new purpose - Remediation -- repairing
contaminated soil - Reconstruction, re‐creation -- actions following
severe disturbance - mine reclamation enhances habitats for wild
ungulates in west Alberta - save topsoil - recommendations - apply
peat‐mineral mix - fertilize with P and K - don't add N - results -
Reclaimed soils have much greater organic matter content (10‐15%) than
mineral soils in natural forests (2‐3%) - conclusions - 1. There is more
organic matter in the soils of reclaimed sites than in the natural
forests. 2. Organic matter is accumulating in upper 10 cm of soil at
reclaimed deciduous and grassland sites. 3. SOM is accumulating quickest
in deciduous sites, moderately in grassland sites, and slowly in spruce
sites.

-   Recommendations

1.  Clearly articulate the duties or services that the ecosystem is
    expected to provide
2.  Design structures such as swales to convey surface runoff to
    receiving areas
3.  Make the surface rough to increase water infiltration and decrease
    runoff
4.  Avoid compacting the soil
5.  Layer soils to provide the optimal balance of water storage and
    drainage
6.  Salvage and re‐apply topsoil
7.  Stockpile soil for as short of time as possible ‐ progressive
    restoration is preferable
8.  Actively revegetate stockpiles to establish propagule banks and keep
    soil biota active
9.  If fresh topsoil is not available, inoculate surface with soil or
    forest floor material
10. Apply organic amendments if SOM and fertility levels are inadequate
    for plant growth
11. Revegetate sites as soon as possible
12. Use a cover crop to hold soil in place and begin building SOM and
    soil biota
13. Include broadleaf species as these accumulate soil organic matter
    faster than conifers
14. Include nitrogen‐fixing plants on sites with adequate P but
    insufficient N
15. Maintain connectivity with surrounding landscape to foster migration
16. Assist migration of keystone soil species through specific
    inoculation
17. Create a diversity of sites and habitats at the landscape level
18. Consider leaving or creating special habitat for rare species
