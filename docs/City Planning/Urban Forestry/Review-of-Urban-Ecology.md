# Review of Urban Ecology


Ecology in cities then Ecology OF Cities then Ecology For Cities
Disciplinary then Interdisciplinary then Transdisciplinary


# Scale, Resolution, and Heterogeneity: The Basics

- Large scale = more zoomed in
- Small scale = less zoomed in
- High Resolution = more data per area
- Low Resolution = less data per area


## Scale and resolution "mismatches"
Challenges in:
- Scientific research
- Linking science and decision-making
- Environmental management
- Environmental modelling
- Assessing ecosystem services
