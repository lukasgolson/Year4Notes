Restoring Biodiversity

-   restoring Fynbos
-   Restoring the Garry Oak ecosystems
    -   shrunk by more than 95% since the time of European Contact
    -   burning, weeding, planting, herbivore exclusion
-   restoring non-plant species
-   Examples of restoring habitat for biodiversity
    -   -salmon -food sources -riparian zones -"green" and "blue" routes
        to allow amphibians and other animals to access ponds?
        (Connectivity) -animals that act as ecosystem engineers (eg.
        beavers) -daylighting streams in the city -plant more native
        plants to support birds
-   how can we restore habitat in cities?
    -   planting to attract certain species
    -   not mowing between highway lanes
    -   more permeable surfaces
    -   parks
    -   pollinator patch
    -   rooftop gardens
    -   remove invasives
    -   green infrastructure
    -   hedges
    -   yard forest (shrubs, and other plants)
    -   allowing wild flowers and weeds to grow (not invasive)
    -   Retain trees as wildlife snags or tree features like hollows
        that are beneficial for wildlife
    -   Protecting streams, and incorporating into city planning rather
        than remove/redirect
    -   create greenways planted with native species that could also
        function as wildlife corridors
    -   Reduce pesticide and rodenticide use in cities
    -   more soil space
    -   effective waste management - prevent algal blooms

Ecological Function

-   hydrological function
-   carbon and nutrient cylcing
-   energy flows, trophic structure \# Ecosystem Services
