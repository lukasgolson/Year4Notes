Strategy:

-   A plan intended to reach a particular purpose
-   Process of planning something or putting a plan into action

 

The golden circle:

Why (inner circle): Least number of companies -- selling values &
purposes (i.e., lifestyle)

How (middle circle): harder, less companies

What (outer circle): nearly all organizations

 

Process of planning:

1.  What do we have?
2.  What do we want?
3.  How do we get what we want?
4.  How do we know that we have gotten it?
