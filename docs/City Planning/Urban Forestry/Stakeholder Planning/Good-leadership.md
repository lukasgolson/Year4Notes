Why is good leadership important in Urban Forestry?

-   Dealing with Staff, Community, Elected & appointed officials /
    boards of directors

 

Must articulate:

-   Vision
-   Goal & Objective Setting
-   Empowerment
    -   Green light / yellow light / red light system
        -   Green light: all good
        -   Yellow light: Maybe deadlines pushed back
        -   Red light: Shit hits the fan; financial loss, political
            implications
-   Training
    -   Everything everyone needs is taken care of
-   Team Building & Nurturing
    -   Norming → Storming → Performing → Forming
        -   Forming: learning about each other
        -   Storming: Challenging each other
        -   Norming: Working with each other
        -   Performing: working as one

 

Good leaders motivates people:

-   Motivation: M.A.P
    -   Mastery: People want to be able to master what they do
    -   Autonominity: People don't want to be guarded 24/7
    -   Purpose: People need to know how what they do ties to the bigger
        picture

 

Three things that lead to job misery = Irrelevance + Anonymity +
Immeasurement

-   Irrelevance: Don't know how work fits into the big picture
-   Anonymity: Others don't know anything about you (lack of human
    connection)
-   Immeasurement: Unable to measure what you do
