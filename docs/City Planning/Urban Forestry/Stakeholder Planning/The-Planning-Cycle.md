Where are we now? Where do we want to go? How do we get there? Have we arrived?



# Where are we now?
- Getting started
- Stakeholders & participation
- Situation Assessment 


- Build team & trust
- Stakeholder analysis:
	- Who are stakeholders?
- Gather key information
- What is the central problem to be addressed

# Where do we want to go?
- Goals:
	- Broad, directional
- Objectives
	- Specific goals under a "theme"
- Positions:
	- What we want
- Interests:
	- Why we want it

# How do we get there?
- Principle/goal
- (Desired result)
	- Criterion/objective
	- (Conditions for success)
		- Indicator
		- (Measureable variable)
			- Measure/verifier
			- (Quantitative information)
- Scenario development
- Tradeoffs and optimization
- Structured decision making
	- Swing weighting
	- Consequence tables


Multiple levels:
- Strategic (e.g., policy)
- Tactical (e.g., procedure)
- Operational (e.g., execution)


We should always be familiar with what level we are planning at.



## Iterative planning across scale and level
How does my strategy at the city level impact the region and vice versa. 



## Power in planning
Always an issuie
- some people sitting at the table is more powerful than others
- Most of the economic interests are paying representatives (e.g., lawyers) to show up to these meetings
- Likewise, many charities / neighborhood groups do not have the resources to hire representatives


## Uncertainty
Conservation problems are often
- complex
- Uncertain
- Involve multiple stakeholders/interests
- Involve potential losses (monetary, cultural, ecological)

A good process and plan will allow you to:
- Uncover values
- Integrate complex technical information
- Understand decision consequences
- Adapt to changing conditions
