# Green Networks
All of a city's **public green spaces**, while **ideally interconnected**, they are in reality fragmented.
- Serve multiple, often **competing functions**
- Provide a **range of ecosystem services**
- Primary functions **change with scale**

Functions of public & green spaces:
Example:
Elements | Functions
-- | --
Streets and Lanes | Social, political activity
Parks | Stormwater management



Green Networks Approach:
- Plannng approach proposing an integrated green system in the city
- Layers discrete components: e.g., parks, greenways, street trees
- Multifunctional; greenspaces serve multiple human and ecosystem functions concurrently
