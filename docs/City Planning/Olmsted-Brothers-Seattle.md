# Olmsted-Brothers Seattle
First plan came out in 1903: 1903 Plan for a parks system

Main principles proposed by J.C. Olmsted:
- Respect the genius of the place
- Orchestration of movement
- A comprehensive approach
- Orchestration of use
	- Not every park needs every element/function/activity
	- Every park is designed with consideration of those around it
- Unified composition
- Employ the existing landscape plants


"The primary aim should be to secure and preserve for the use the people ... these advantages of water and mountain views and of woodlands... An ideal system would involve taking all of the borders of the different bodies of water... and to enlarge these fringes at suitable and convenient points" (JCO, 1903)
