Dendro and tree rings
-> Mostly uses NDVI, research should explore being this

Spatial distribution modelling
-> Reduce suitability uncertainty
1. Identify fine-scale current and future suitable sites for tree species
2. Enhance spatial distribution models by integrtation biotic variables
	1. Normally the models are based on abiotic variables
	2. PResence/Asence, = Climate + soil + lidar topography rasters
Takeaways:
- Refining models enhances ecological insight
- Adop conservative assumptions
- Focus on near-term projection, limit extrapolation
- Use basal area, abundance,and composition
