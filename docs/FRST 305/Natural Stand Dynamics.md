- Stand dynamics describe the processes of change over time in forest stand structure, including the disturbance (start and end).

For example:
Forest burns down -> regeneration -> phase where the forest density increases -> old growth

Disturbance Regime:
- Describes the temporal and spatial characteristics of a disturbance agent, and its impact on the landscape.
	- Temporal Characteristics
	- Spatial
	- Impact
- Frequency of stand-initiating events varies with ecosystem type
- Return interval is key to stand development and landscape level heterogeneity




Stand Initiation
* Growing space is available
* Early pioneer species dominate
* Trees establish until all growing space is occupied


Stem Exclusion
- All growing space is in use
- Competition among trees
- No regeneration
- Branch mortality - Living crown moves up
- Number of trees declines due to mortality

Understory re-initiation
- Overstory is less dense
- Self-thinning occurs
- Growing space becomes slowly available
- Shade tolerant species regenerate and form a new understory


Old Growth:
- Trees can grow large
- Over time, trees in the overstory die and are replaced
- Gap phase:
	- Mortality of old trees creates space for regeneration
- Pioneer species are rare


Consequences for silviculture
* Silviculture practice aims at imitating natural disturbances
	* Important for biodiversity and habitat quality
	* Natural stand dynamics automate processes with desirable outcomes, for example:
		* Branch mortality
		* Increased diversity and flexibility through stratification
* Knowledge about how tree species can make use of the growing space is key
	* Silvics
	* Competitiveness
	* Facilitation


Key Takeaways:
* Stand dynamics depend on the ecosystem with its species and disturbance regime
* Over the long term, structurally rich, uneven-aged stands form when disturbance is rare
* Disturbance regimes differ strongly across ecosystems
* Trees compete for growing space
* Knowledge about successional stage is key for developing silvicultural prescriptions that utilize natural processes for your objectives
