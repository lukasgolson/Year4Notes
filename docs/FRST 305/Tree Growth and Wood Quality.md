# What determines growth of trees?
- Genetics
- Space
	- Sunlight, CO2 -> production of Carbohydrates
	- Constrained by:
		- The enironment
			- Sunlight, water, nutrients, physical space (i.e., growing space)
		- Genetics:
			- Adaptations (natural selection)
			- Random (e.g., bottleneck effects)
- Interaction of genetics (g) and environment (e) determines growth
	- Growth = GXE



# How do trees allocate carbohydrates?
## Primarily survival: 
1. Respiration maintenance
2. Foliage renewal
3. Fine root renewal
4. Reproduction

## Secondary allocation: Primary growth
- Terminal and lateral branch expansion
- Root expansion
- Phloem renewal

## Tertiary allocation: Secondary Growth
1. Xylem renewal, basal increments
2. Production of resin/gum/chemicals for protection


# How are carbohydrates used?
Process | Dominant | Co-Dominant | Suppressed
-- | -- | -- | --
Respiration | 26% | 29% | 50%
Secondary Growth | 42% | 41% | 8%


# Tree Crown
## Production Centre:
Through photosyntehsis, sunlight and carbon dioxide is transformed into carbohydrates
- Most productive area is above canopy horizon


Indicators for productive crowns
* Crown ratio (% of tree height)
* Crown diameter


# Crown and stem form
Crown and stem form is determined by two types of growth "behaviors":
- Decurrent: Grows towards the light
- Excurrent: Growth is geocentric - towards the center of the earth

Strong differences between species, but also within species


Apical dominance: Important for wood quality




# Tree Roots
1. Plate root systems
2. Sinker root systems
3. Heart Root System
4. Tap Root System


# Stem Function
- Heartwood vs. sapwood

Sapwood: 
- Phloem: Downward transportation of carbohydrates from the leaves
- Xylem: Transportation of water through xylem conduits
- Storage of carbohydrates in the parenchyma

Heartwood:
- Completely dead center area; stability


Defense:
- Bark, resin, gum

Physical support of the crown


# Stem growth
- Ring width decreases towards the bark
- High quality wood with narrow rings grows on old trees
- Ring width by stem height:
	- Thicker rings at the top
