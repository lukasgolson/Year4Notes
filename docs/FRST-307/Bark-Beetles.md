## Bark Beetles
(Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae)
Feed within subcortical tissues (e.g. phloem) of virtually all parts of woody and herbaceous plants
- Roots
- Stems/boles
- Branches/twigs
- Fruits/cones

Generally mono- to oligophagous
- They only like one (mono) to a few species (oligophagous)

Most commonly associated with conifers as disturbance agents
- High diversity in conifer ecosystems




## Roles and impacts
Consumption of phloem tissue kills part or all of a tree

Ecological roles:
	- Succession
		- Species removal
	- Soil nutrient cycles
		- Decay processes (e.g. fungi)
	- Fire cycles
		- Ecosystem renewal

Socio-economic impacts:
- Production forestry
	- Decaying dead trees non-merchantable
- Aesthetics
	- Loss of high-value trees on private lands
- Wildland-urban interface
	- Fuel loading, fire risk
	- Tree failure
- Biodiversity/endangered species
	- Ecosystem alterations
- Water quantity/quality
	- Watershed alteration
- Carbon dynamics
	- CO2 release from dead organic matter


## General Biology
### Brood production
- Mating
- Gallery construction
- Oviposition
- Brood Development


Males or females initiate attacks (species dependent)
Male initiators = males excavate nuptial gallery for mating
- Multiple females (polygamous)
- Egg galleries (one per female) extend from nuptial chambers

Female initiators = mating at bark surface
- Most species +/- monogamous
- Females create single egg gallery

Gallery patterns (with host-tree identification) often characteristic of species



#### Gallery creation versus tunneling/scoring
- Galleries are created by multiple, related individuals (offspring/sibling) whereas tunnels are created by one individual


Females:
- Lay eggs singly or in groups in niches along margins of gallery
- Niches packed with frass
- Fecundity from several to 300 eggs/females

Males
- Frequently assist females by cleaning galleries
- Adaptations for clearing frass/boring dust:
	- Elytral declivity, flattened head capsule, hairiness


#### Brood production 3
- Larvae feed and develop through several instars [[FRST-307/Definitions]]
- Pupation occurs in enlarged chambers at the end of larval galleries or in common feeding area
- Young (i.e. tuneral) adults often feed to complete maturation (increase flight muscles, acquire symbionts, sclerotize (harden))
- Mature adults cut exit hole to outside
- Maturation feeding may involve other plant parts (e.g. European elm bark beetle)


#### Brood production 4
- The number of generations per year (i.e. voltinism) may be less than 1 (semivoltine) to 7-8 (multivoltine)
- One generation per year (univoltine) most common in Canada


#### Brood Production 5
Temperature is very important (based on elevation or latitude or both)

- Within a species, the number of generations per year may vary with climatic conditions
- Climate-related population asynchrony may cause significant mortality
	- Delayed/advanced development cause cold susceptible stages to overwinter
	- Prolonged adult emergence reduces chances of mating


## Emergence/dispersal
- Flight
- Host selection
- Environmental impacts
	- Temp, humidity, light


- Optimal temperature and humidity required for emergence and flight
- Avoid rain and winds > maximum flight speed
- Short window of emergence to maximize chances of finding mates/hosts


- Flight period may be required before beetles become receptive to cues from hosts or conspecifics (other beetles)
	- Ensures population dispersal, minimizes intraspecific competition.

- Dispersal both short and long range
- Most beetles fly beneath canopy (short-range dispersal, upwind flight when seeking hosts or mates)
- Small percentage fly above canopy (long-range dispersal)


Host selection (primary attraction)
- Cues
	- Light/temperature (stand density)
	- Visual (large vertical silhouettes)
	- Olfactory (e.g. ethanol, terpenes)
- Cascade of decisions:
1. Host versus non-host species
2. Susceptible versus resistant
3. High versus low quality
4. Presence/absence of competitor species
5. Presence/absence of conspecifics


## Colonization
- Beetle-tree interactions
- Mortality factors
	- Tree defense
	- Competition
	- Predation

- Host acceptance based on gustatory stimulation (i.e. taste)
- Following acceptance (by pioneer beetles)
	- Release of aggregation pheromones (both sexes)
	- Response by conspecifics (secondary attraction)



Trees produce resin as defense against attacks
- Most bark beetles select trees with impaired defenses
	- Drought, disease, windthrow, suppression, age
	- "secondary species"
- Some species don't care
	- "primary species"

Primary beetles:
- Preferentially attack large diameter vigorous trees
- Succesful attack requires tree mortality
- Occasionally undergo population eruoptions (i.e. outbreaks) and cause mortality over landscapes

Secondary:
- Preferentially attack suppressed trees


Tree defenses
- succesful colonization contingent on tree death
	- Trees have evolved defensive responses
	- Constitutive resinosus
		- Preformed resin ducts or pockets exude pitch
		- Mainly physical barrier
	- Induced resinosus
		- Cellular necrosis (autolysis) and release of toxins
	- Defense = vigour


#### Symbionts
Evolved to carry one or more species of fungi

Symbiosis: two unlike organisms living together for mutual benefit
All bark beetles carry symbiotic organisms - mostly fungi
Mutual benefits
fungi | beetle
-- | --
Transport to new host | tree pathogen
blank | habitat modification
 blank | nutrition
 
 Mycangia (adj. = mycangial)
 - structures that carry and sometimes nurture fungal spores
 - Located mainly on head or mouthparts

Phoresy (ad. = phoretic)
- Spores carried on body


#### Semiochemicals:
- Chemical messengers
	- Insect-modified tree defenses
	- Pheremones: Cause a specific reaction in a receiving organism of the same species
		- E.g. aggregation, anti-aggregation
	- Kairomones: Evoke in the receiver a reaction that favours the receiver but not the emitter
		- E.g. host/prey location
	- Allomones: Evoke in the receiver a reaction that favours the emitter, but not the receiver
		- E.g. interspecific territoriality
	- Potential multifunctionality
		- E.g., one species' pheremone = another species' kairomone


#### Competition
- Intraspecific competition significant density-dependent mortality
- Optimal attack density to overcome tree resistance before competitive effects
- MEchanisms to minimize overcrowding: stridulation (chirping)

Resource quality:
- Tree quality = phloem thickness
	- Better nutrition
	- Less competition
	- Faster development
	- More offspring




#### Abiotic mortality factors
- Largest source of mortality following colonization
- Primarily temperature related
	- Direct effects on beetles
		- Growth and development
		- Survival
	- Indirect effects on host trees
		- Phloem moisture
	- Beetle adaptations:
		- Diapause
		- Cold tolerance
	- Cold-related mortality greatest during unseasonable events
		- E.g. cold snaps in autumn or spring



## Bark Beetle Management
Sampling bark beetles
- Pheremone-baited multple funnel traps (i.e. Lindgren traps)
	- Best for presence/absence detection (i.e. monitoring)
		- Pheremones only 1 cue considered by foraging beetles
- Aerial and ground surveys
	- Aerial (low altitude fixed- or rotary-wing aircraft) detection of last years red attacked trees followed by ground surveys to detect new green attacks
		- Trees attacked in one year do not reliably show symptoms in crowns until the following year once beetles have finished development
		- Red attack tree = where beetles were not are
		- Green attack trees = signs of beetle colonization on bole only
- Aerial overview surveys
	- Since 1959, BC has employed annual aerial surveys. Some of the best data in the world.
	- Broad (high altitude fixed-wing aircraft); surveys of landscapes to assess population distribution and tree mortality
	- Suitable for extensive epidemics
- Remote sensing
	- Much promise, slow adoption

#### Two approaches
- (indirect) Modify existing stands to make them less good for beetles
- (direct) Or look for problematic populations and manipulate those populations



- Indirect control (proactive) = management of populations through tactics that reduce forest susceptibility (not yet widely operational, but is what we should be doing)
	- GET NOTES FROM SLIDES
- Direct control (reactive) = management of populations through tactics that kill populations early
	- Reduction of beetle pop'n
	- Strategy = population reduction greater than yearly population increase
	- Tactics:
		- Chemical tactics **irrelevant and unacceptable**
			- Bark beetles live under the bark of trees and are not exposed to any chemicals we could apply
			- Not legal in Canada
			- Environmental concerns
		- Cultural/mechanical tactics
			- Fire
				- Single trees felled, bucked, and burned on stump
				- Broadcast burning - unsuitable for direct control
					- Crown fires required for significant beetle mortality
			- Debarking
			- Harvesting and processing
				- Single trees
				- Stands - sanitation logging
				- Trap trees (note: spruce beetle, Douglas-fir beetle only)
					- Leave highly susceptible trees/logs behind for beetles to infest, followed by prompt removal and destruction
			- Semiochemical tactics (in combination with above)
				- "post-logging mop up" -- aggregation pheremones in residual trees after logging
				- "Containment and concentration" - aggregation pheremones in harvest blocks before logging
				- "Push-pull" - anti-aggregation pheremones in unharvested areas, aggregation pheremones in harvest blocks


### Management Theory
Direct control: a framework for success
- Rate of Increase (R) = 2 == roughly 500 trees killed by year 10
	- 190 rees saved by removal of 3 of 8 infested trees in year 4
		- Population continues to increase though
- Control must exceed rate of increase
- P greater than 1-1/R (R = rate of increase) (P = proportion of trees treated)
- How much is enough?
	- Use credit card payment formulas

#### Examples of success
Banf, Alberta - 1940's
- Incipient MPB epidemic
- Entomologist + very large crews
- All trees surveyed over 2 years, infested trees destroyed
- Epidemic suppressed by year 3


#### Take home messages
- Successful direct control strategies require detailed knowledge of:
	- Population size (and location)
	- Potential rate of increase
		- Look under bark and record how many eggs laid by females
		- Alternatively, look at spread
	- Direct control tactics must:
		- Be early and aggressive
		- Treat more than the anticipated growth in the pop'n given its size and rate of increase
		- Persist as long as causes of pop'n increase remain operative (or until management objectives are achieved)
