- How do insects cause disturbance?
- Herbivory 
- Forest insect “guilds”
- Examples

### Injury versus Damage
#### Injury (herbivory, disease)
- Physical or physiological losses to trees caused by biotic agent (e.g., reduction in leaf area or photosynthesis)

#### Damage:
- Economic losses caused by insects (e.g., reduction in yield or quality at time of harvest)


## Insect diversity and abundance
- Insects account for most (53% of abundance) animals on earth
- There are ~1 million described (~30 orders)
	- Estimated 5-30 million
- ~60,000 invertebrates in BC
	- ~35,000 insects
- less than 1% of insects considered pests


## Herbivory and disturbance
[[disturbance]] = any discrete event that disrupts forest ecosystem, community, or population structure and/or function
- Insect disturbance is the consequence of herbivory (consumption of plant tissue)
- Herbivory causes:
	- Growth loss
	- Deformation
	- Mortality
		- E.g., phloem herbivory
- Herbivory is mainly by juvenile stages
	- Especially for holometabolous insects
		- Juvenilles Basically bags with mouths that try to eat as much as possible
		- Adults are specialized in reproduction and dispersal



## Insect Herbivore "Guilds"
- Guild = Any group of species that exploit the same resource, or that exploits different resources in related ways
- Forest insect herbivore guilds:
	- Sucking and galling insects 
	- Seed and cone insects 
	- Root and lower-stem insects 
	- Shoot feeders 
	- Woodborers 
	- Defoliators 
	- Bark beetles (bole feeders)
	



### Group 1: Sucking / galling insects
#### Nature of feeding
- Piercing/sucking mouthparts
	- Positive pressure in phloem is like a firehose to the small insects
		- Can't possibly digest all the sugar
- Plant part specialists
- Often prefer healthy/vigorous hosts
- Some species create galls as shelters

#### Nature of injury
- Nutrient loss
- Pathogen transmission
- Phytotoxins and allergic reactions
- Most serious pests are introduced and invasive

#### Examples:
**Insect**: Balsam woolly adegild (*Aldelges piceae*)
**Hosts**: all true first
**Inury**: Deformation, mortality

**Insect:** Cooley spruce gall adelgid (*Adelges cooleyi*)
**Hosts:** spruces, Douglas-fir
**Injury** Aesthetics (i.e., visual)

### Group 2: Seed and cone insects
#### Nature of feeding
- Direct or indirect feeding on tree reproductive organs
- Obligate = Feed only on seeds/cones
- Facultative = feed on seeds/cones when available

#### Nature of injury
- Reduced production of viable seed

#### Examples:
**Insect:** Western conifer seed bug (*Leptoglossus occidentalis*)
**Hosts**: Most conifers
**Injury** Direct seed destruction

### Group 3: Root and lower stem insects
#### Nature of feeding:
- Commonly associated with fungi
- Root-feeding insects:
	- Greatest injury to managed stands; increasing importance in forestry
- Lower-stem insects
	- Most commonly associated with mature stands

#### Nature of injury
*- Consumption of cambial tissues of roots and lower stems*
- Growth loss, potential mortality

#### Examples:
**Insect**: Warren's root collar weevil (*Hylobius warreni*)
**Hosts**: Lodgepole pine, spruce species
**Injury**: Mortality of young trees
- Not much of an issue for mature trees; becomes problematic when it feeds on young trees; Feeds on base of root collar, girdling young trees
- Issue where mountain pine beetle has ravaged landscape
	- When we plant near these areas with new pine, Warren's root collar weevil will migrate to our new saplings

**Insect**: Red turpentine beetle (*Dendroctonus valens*)
**Hosts**: Lodgepole pine, ponderosa pine
**Injury**: Mortality of stressed trees
**Notes**: From oregon, invasive to China; not much of an issue in North America

### Group 4: Shoot insects
#### Nature of feeding:
- Specialization on elongating shoots
* *Preference for young, vigorous trees*

#### Nature of injury:
- Growth loss, longer rotation
- Malformation
- Impacts greatest on youngest trees
- Injury often positively related to tree growth:
	- Making trees grow faster will often worsen disease

#### Examples:
Insect: White pine weevil (spruce weevil) (*Pissodes strobi*)
Hosts: Spruce and pine species
Injury: growth loss, deformation
Notes: Minimum 2 year growth loss


Insects: Bud moths (Zeiraphera spp.)
Hosts: Spruce and larch species
Injury: growth loss, deformation


### Group 5: Woodborers
#### Nature of feeding
- Develop in phloem and sapwood
- Associated with stressed, dead trees
- Attracted to volatiles associated with wood deterioration
	- E.g., ethanol

#### Nature of injury
- Kill or weakn live trees (stressed)
- Some species associated with fungi
- Impact wood products
- Significant potential as invasive species

#### Examples:
Insect: Golden buprestid (*Buprestis aurulenta*)
Hosts: Doug fir, pine species
Injury: Sapwood boring

Weird lifestage:
- Can grow in freshly cut lumber,  if not kiln dry
- Once it grows into wood, it might not emerge for over 40 years
- Can emerge from wood that's used in building


Insect: Striped ambrosia beetle (*Trypodendron lineatum*)
Hosts: Most conifers
Injury: Sapwood boring

Are farmers: They bore to grow fungi, they harvest, and use to feed their offspring
- Offspring dont do anything but wait for food

### Group 6: Defoliators
#### Nature of feeding:
- General preference for young foliage
- Some species feed on old foliage

#### Nature of injury
- Feeding causes loss of photosynthetic organs

#### Examples:
Insect: Western spruce budworm (*Choristoneura occidentalis*)
Hosts: Douglas-fir, other conifers
Injury: Growth loss, mortality


Insect: Western hemlock looper (*Lambdina fiscellaria lugubrosa*)
Hosts: Western hemlock, other conifers
Injury: growth loss, mortality



### Group 7: Bark Beetles
#### Nature of feeding
- General preference for older trees
*- Feed beneath bark on phloem tissues*
- Complex adaptations to overcome tree defenses
	- When faced with defensive efforts form the tree, their able to digest many tree defence chemicals and synthesis them into useful chemicals
- Nature of injury
	- For many species, succesful reproduction requires tree death
	- Close association with pathogenic fungi
		- Can't live without it
	- Several species prone to outbreaks
	- Population eruptions commonly associated with tree stress

#### Examples:
Insect: Mountain pine beetle (*Dendroctonus ponderosae*)
Hosts: Pine species
Damage: Tree mortality

Female beetles initiate aggregation to the tree, produce aggregation pheremones;
- Attracts more beetles
- Produces more beetles
- Creates positive feedback loop


Insect: Spruce beetle (*Dendroctonus rufipennis*)
Hosts: Spruce species
Damage: Tree mortality
