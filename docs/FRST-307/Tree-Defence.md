# Tree Defence
### IMPORTANT LECTURE


Plants are not passive partners when getting munched on/hurt by disturbances
- They are actually very dynamic

The way that plants and animals interact may have impacted nearly all animal evolution



Tree Defenses:
- Lecture outline:
	- General introduction, the "green tree parodox"
	- Tree Defences
		- Types: Physical, Chemical, Symbioses, Natural Enemy Manipulation
		**- Forms: Constitutive or Induced**
	- The importance of redundant lines of defense: Conifer vs stem insects



## The "green tree paradox": Why aren't all trees killed?
An evolutionary arms race:
- Trees evolve "slowly", but herbivorous insects can evolve "very quickly"
	- In 100 years:
		- ~Trees less than 1 generation;
		- ~Insects greater than 100 generations
			- Populations of target species started to evolve resistance to the insecticide DDT over only ~7 years


## Why aren't all trees killed?
- Constraints on insect fitness:
	- Environment (e.g. climatic suitability)
	- Host availability
		- Physical availability
			- Alpha diversity (species)
			- Beta diversity (landscapes)
			- Gamma diversity (region/biomes)
		- Realized availability
			- Genetic diversity (quantity/quality of preferred tissues)
**Tree Defence**



### Tree defenses against herbivory: different types:
- Physical (e.g. trichomes, leaf toughness, etc.)
- Chemical
- Symbiotic relationships
- Natural Enemy Manipulation



## Two different forms:
- Constitutive:
	- Passive preformed defenses
		- Physical 
			- Bark
			- Stone cells
			- Thorns
			- Trichomes
			- Oleoresin/Latex
			- Leaf toughness
				- Cellulose
				- Mineral Inclusion
		- Chemical
	- Developed simply by growing
		- E.g., spines/thorns
		- E.g., resinous blisters on Abies
- Induced:
	- Active defensive response
		- Mostly Chemicals
		- Energetically costly to produce
			- Suppressed trees or those without excess energy stores are at a disadvantage
		- Released when tree detects that it is being harmed



#### Chemical Defense (constitutive and induced)
- Secondary metabolites: organic compounds that do not have function in growth and development
	- Plant-plant competition (allelochemicals)
	- Plant microbe symbiosis
	- Attractants
		- Defense against pathogens

### Constitutive:
- Chemicals released from preformed structures due to injury
	- Deter/hinder feeding
	- Reduce digestibility of tissues (e.g. tannin)
- Mostly carbon-based compounds
- Terpenoids
	- Isoprene units
	- Monoterpenes = isoprene units C10H16
	- Other terpenes = multiples of C5 units (e.g. di-, tri-, sequi-)
- Induced
	- Chemicals produced by living tissues in response to injury
		- Toxins intended to kill

### Induced chemical defense:
- Active response to injury
- Mostly nitrogenous compounds

Three groups of secondary metabolites
- Nitrogen containing secondary products
	- E.g., nicotine, morphine, cocaine, caffeine, quinine
- Phenolic compounds
	- Flavonoids
	- Anthocyanins
	- Salicylic acid
	- Tannin
- Terpenoids
	- Limonoids
	- Saponins
	- Pinenes

#### Tree defense: symbionts:
##### Ants:
- e.g., swollen-thorn acacia
- Pseudomyrmex ants protect the tree as it provides them living space (hallow thorns) and protein-rich food (Beltian bodies)


##### Epiphytes:
- Microorganisms on leaf surfaces
- Bacteria and fungi
	- Prevents herbivory/infection

##### Endophytes
- primarily fungi
- ubiquous in vascular plants
- Systemic infections prevent herbivory
	- Herbivory
	- Drying


##### Natural enemy manipulation:
- Plants attract insect herbivore natural enemies
	- Herbivory stimulates release of volatile chemicals
	- Parasitoid wasps attracted to injured plant

# Redundant lines of defense:
-Conifer defense mechanisms redundancies:
	- First line (constitutive) = bark, stone cells
		- Physical
	- Second line (constitutive) = primary resinosis
		- Physical and chemical
	- Third line (induced) = secondary resinosis
		- Chemical


# Effects of resinosis
- Physical barrier
	- Viscous
	- Rapid crystalization
	- Large volumes
- Chemical barrier
	- Toxic monoterpenes
	- Fungistatic activity
	- Digestion inhibition


## Primary resin
- Constitutive defense
- Preformed compounds
	- Oleoresin
	- Mostly terpenoids
- Species-specific deployment
	- Resin Canals (e.g. Pinus spp.)
	- Resin Blisters (e.g. Abies spp.)
	- Qualitative factors
		- Species and populative-specific terpenoid porilfes
		- Basis for resistance selection


## Secondary resin
- Induced defense
	- Parenchyma cells lyse (rupture)
	- Resin canals increase in size and number
	- Qualitatively different from primary resin
		- Change in relative abundance of terpenoid consituents
		- More toxic compounds favoured

Induced defense: an effective barrier to invasion
- Dramatic host response to insect/pathogen invasion
- Formation of reaction zone
	- Rapid involvement of tissues surrounding points of penetration
	- Parenchyma cell death (autolysis)
	- Depletion of sugars
	- Formation of wound periderm
	- Secondary resin soaks area of response
- Seals invading organisms in lesion of dead tissue
- Occurs fast in healthy trees, slow in unhealthy trees
