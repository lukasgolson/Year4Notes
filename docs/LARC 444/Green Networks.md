Green Networks: All of a city's **public green spaces**, while **ideally interconnected**, they are in reality fragmented.
- Serve multiple, often **competing functions**
- Provide a **range of ecosystem services**
- Primary functions **change with scale**

Functions of public & green spaces:
Example:
Elements | Functions
