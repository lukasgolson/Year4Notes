Primitive Insect:
- Cold blooded (ectothermic)

Built on 3 parts:
- Head
	- Two sets of eyes
		- Compound Eyes
		- ocelli
	- Mouths
	- Antennae
		- Often used to sniff the air for chemical compounds
			- E.g., food, mates
- Thorax
	- Movement
		- Where legs are attached (3 pairs)
		- Where wings are attached (typically 2 pairs)
- Abdomen
	- Where guts are located
	- Used for breathing


What makes an insect? The body plan...
- Three tagmata
	1. <u>Head</u> - Perception (vision, smell, taste), feeding
		- Most orders have developed certain types of adaptations
			- Specializations of each type of tagmata
		- Mouthparts
			1. <u>Chewing</u> (standard way of being)
				1. E.g., grasshopper
				2. Tiger beetle (Coleoptera)
			2. <u>Piercing and sucking</u>
				1. Mosquito (diptera)
			3. <u>Siphoning</u>
				1. Butterfly (lepidoptera)
				2. Fleas (Siphonaptera)
			4. <u>Sponging</u>
				1. House flies
	2. Thorax
		- Leg parts
			- Cursorial (running)
			- Fossorial (digging)
			- Raptorial (grasping)
			- Saltatorial (jumping)
			- Natatorial (swimming)
		- Wing Parts
			- Odonata
				- Primitive, 2 "equal" pair, membranous
			- Hemiptera
				- Forewings partially sclerotized (i.e. hardened)
			- Hymenoptera
				- Membranous, forewings larger than hindwings, held together by hamuli (small hooks)
			- Coleoptera
				- Forewings completely sclerotized
			- Lepidoptera
				- Forewings larger than hindwings, covered with scales
			- Diptera
				- Hindwings replaced by halteres
	3. Abdomen
		- Oviposition
			- (Hymenoptera: Icheneumonidae)
		- Defense/display
			- (Dermaptera: Labiduridae)
		- Display
			- (Coleoptera:  Lampyridae)
		- Respiration/gills
			- (Odanata: Lestidae)




The exoskeleton:
	- Prevent water loss
	- protect from natural enemies
	- Muscle attachment
Cuticle (critical to success of insecta; contains chiten)
Epidermis (cellular)
Cuticle + epidermis = integument



Nervous system
- Largely decentralised
- Brain controls eyes, antennae, and mouthparts
- Thoricic (peripheral) ganglia control legs and wings
- Abdominal (peripheral) ganglia control gut and reproductive controls

Circulatory system
- Open ended system
- Nutrient transport
- Immune system
- Hydraulic mechanism
- Blood = hemolymph
- <u>No</u> thermoregulation
- <u>Not</u> involved in respiration


Digestive system
- A "one-way" system
- Foregut = breakdown of large food particles (using saliva)
- Midgut = enzymatic digestion
- Hindgut = fecal pellets and excretion

Respiratory system
- Completely dependent on passive diffusion
- O2 enters insect via spiracles, trachea, and tracheoles
- Diffuses into tissues
- Implications for body size
